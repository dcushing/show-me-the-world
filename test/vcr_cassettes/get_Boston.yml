        the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765, a Boston mob ravaged the homes of

        The British sent two regiments to Boston in 1768 in an attempt to quell the
        angry colonists. This did not sit well with the colonists. In 1770, during
        the [[Boston Massacre]], the army killed several people in response to a mob
        in Boston. The colonists compelled the British to withdraw their troops. The
        event was widely publicized and fueled a revolutionary movement in America.<ref

        of the colonists saw the act as an attempt to force them to accept the taxes
        established by the [[Townshend Acts]]. The act prompted the [[Boston Tea Party]],
        where a group of rebels threw an entire shipment of tea sent by the British
        [[East India Company]] into [[Boston Harbor]]. The Boston Tea Party was a
        key event leading up to the revolution, as the British government responded
        furiously with the [[Intolerable Acts]], demanding compensation for the lost
        tea from the rebels.<ref name=\"newamernation\" /> This angered the colonists
        further and led to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The war began in the

        itself was besieged for almost a year during the [[Siege of Boston]], which
        began on April 19, 1775. The New England militia impeded the movement of the
        [[British Army]]. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe]], then the commander-in-chief
        of the British forces in North America, led the British army in the siege.
        On June 17, the British captured the [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown peninsula]]
        in Boston, during the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. The British army outnumbered
        the militia stationed there, but it was a [[Pyrrhic victory]] for the British
        because their army suffered devastating casualties. It was also a testament
        to the power and courage of the militia, as their stubborn defending made
        it difficult for the British to capture Charlestown without losing many troops.<ref

        to unify the revolutionary effort. Both sides faced difficulties and supply
        shortages in the siege, and the fighting was limited to small-scale raids
        and skirmishes. On March 4, 1776, Washington commanded his army to [[Fortification
        of Dorchester Heights|fortify Dorchester Heights]], an area of Boston. The
        army placed cannons there to repel a British invasion against their stake
        in Boston. Washington was confident the army could resist a small-scale invasion
        with their fortifications. Howe planned an invasion into Boston, but bad weather
        delayed their advance. Howe decided to withdraw, because the storm gave Washington''s
        army more time to improve their fortifications. British troops evacuated Boston
        on March 17, which solidified the revolutionaries'' control of the city.<ref

        and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United
        States, as well as the 21st most populous city in the United States. The city
        proper covers 48 square miles (124 km2) with an estimated population of 694,583
        in 2018, making it also the most populous city in New England. Boston is the
        seat of Suffolk County as well, although the county government was disbanded
        on July 1, 1999. The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially
        larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston, a metropolitan statistical
        area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 4.8 million people in 2016 and ranking
        as the tenth-largest such area in the country. As a combined statistical area
        (CSA), this wider commuting region is home to some 8.2 million people, making
        it the sixth most populous in the United States.Boston is one of the oldest
        municipalities in the United States, founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630
        by Puritan settlers from England. It was the scene of several key events of
        the American Revolution, such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party,
        the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the Siege of Boston. Upon gaining U.S. independence
        from Great Britain, it continued to be an important port and manufacturing
        hub as well as a center for education and culture. The city has expanded beyond
        the original peninsula through land reclamation and municipal annexation.
        Its rich history attracts many tourists, with Faneuil Hall alone drawing more
        than 20 million visitors per year. Boston''s many firsts include the United
        States'' first public park (Boston Common, 1634), first public or state school
        (Boston Latin School, 1635) and first subway system (Tremont Street Subway,
        1897).Today, Boston is a thriving port city. The Boston area''s many colleges
        and universities make it an international center of higher education, including
        law, medicine, engineering, and business, and the city is considered to be
        a world leader in innovation and entrepreneurship, with nearly 2,000 startups.
        Boston''s economic base also includes finance, professional and business services,
        biotechnology, information technology, and government activities. Households
        in the city claim the highest average rate of philanthropy in the United States;
        businesses and institutions rank among the top in the country for environmental
        sustainability and investment. The city has one of the highest costs of living
        in the United States as it has undergone gentrification, though it remains
        high on world livability rankings.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Colonial ===\nBoston''s
        early European settlers had first called the area Trimountaine (after its
        \"three mountains,\" only traces of which remain today) but later renamed
        it Boston after Boston, Lincolnshire, England, the origin of several prominent
        colonists. The renaming on September 7, 1630, (Old Style) was by Puritan colonists
        from England who had moved over from Charlestown earlier that year in quest
        for fresh water. Their settlement was initially limited to the Shawmut Peninsula,
        at that time surrounded by the Massachusetts Bay and Charles River and connected
        to the mainland by a narrow isthmus. The peninsula is thought to have been
        inhabited as early as 5000 BC.In 1629, the Massachusetts Bay Colony''s first
        governor John Winthrop led the signing of the Cambridge Agreement, a key founding
        document of the city. Puritan ethics and their focus on education influenced
        its early history; America''s first public school, Boston Latin School, was
        founded in Boston in 1635. Over the next 130 years, the city participated
        in four French and Indian Wars, until the British defeated the French and
        their Indian allies in North America.\nBoston was the largest town in British
        America until Philadelphia grew larger in the mid-18th century. Boston''s
        oceanfront location made it a lively port, and the city primarily engaged
        in shipping and fishing during its colonial days. However, Boston stagnated
        in the decades prior to the Revolution. By the mid-18th century, New York
        City and Philadelphia surpassed Boston in wealth. Boston encountered financial
        difficulties even as other cities in New England grew rapidly.\n\n\n=== Revolution
        and the Siege of Boston ===\n\nMany of the crucial events of the American
        Revolution occurred in or near Boston. Boston''s penchant for mob action along
        with the colonists'' growing distrust in Britain fostered a revolutionary
        spirit in the city. When the British government passed the Stamp Act in 1765,
        a Boston mob ravaged the homes of Andrew Oliver, the official tasked with
        enforcing the Act, and Thomas Hutchinson, then the Lieutenant Governor of
        Massachusetts. The British sent two regiments to Boston in 1768 in an attempt
        to quell the angry colonists. This did not sit well with the colonists. In
        1770, during the Boston Massacre, the army killed several people in response
        to a mob in Boston. The colonists compelled the British to withdraw their
        troops. The event was widely publicized and fueled a revolutionary movement
        in America.In 1773, Britain passed the Tea Act. Many of the colonists saw
        the act as an attempt to force them to accept the taxes established by the
        Townshend Acts. The act prompted the Boston Tea Party, where a group of rebels
        threw an entire shipment of tea sent by the British East India Company into
        Boston Harbor. The Boston Tea Party was a key event leading up to the revolution,
        as the British government responded furiously with the Intolerable Acts, demanding
        compensation for the lost tea from the rebels. This angered the colonists
        further and led to the American Revolutionary War. The war began in the area
        surrounding Boston with the Battles of Lexington and Concord.\n\nBoston itself
        was besieged for almost a year during the Siege of Boston, which began on
        April 19, 1775. The New England militia impeded the movement of the British
        Army. William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe, then the commander-in-chief of the
        British forces in North America, led the British army in the siege. On June
        17, the British captured the Charlestown peninsula in Boston, during the Battle
        of Bunker Hill. The British army outnumbered the militia stationed there,
        but it was a Pyrrhic victory for the British because their army suffered devastating
        casualties. It was also a testament to the power and courage of the militia,
        as their stubborn defending made it difficult for the British to capture Charlestown
        without losing many troops.Several weeks later, George Washington took over
        the militia after the Continental Congress established the Continental Army
        to unify the revolutionary effort. Both sides faced difficulties and supply
        shortages in the siege, and the fighting was limited to small-scale raids
        and skirmishes. On March 4, 1776, Washington commanded his army to fortify
        Dorchester Heights, an area of Boston. The army placed cannons there to repel
        a British invasion against their stake in Boston. Washington was confident
        the army could resist a small-scale invasion with their fortifications. Howe
        planned an invasion into Boston, but bad weather delayed their advance. Howe
        decided to withdraw, because the storm gave Washington''s army more time to
        improve their fortifications. British troops evacuated Boston on March 17,
        which solidified the revolutionaries'' control of the city.\n\n\n=== Post-revolution
        and the War of 1812 ===\n\nAfter the Revolution, Boston''s long seafaring
        tradition helped make it one of the world''s wealthiest international ports,
        with the slave trade, rum, fish, salt, and tobacco being particularly important.
        Boston''s harbor activity was significantly curtailed by the Embargo Act of
        1807 (adopted during the Napoleonic Wars) and the War of 1812. Foreign trade
        returned after these hostilities, but Boston''s merchants had found alternatives
        for their capital investments in the interim. Manufacturing became an important
        component of the city''s economy, and the city''s industrial manufacturing
        overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century.
        Boston remained one of the nation''s largest manufacturing centers until the
        early 20th century, and was known for its garment production and leather-goods
        industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it
        to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation
        of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the
        region''s industry and commerce.\n\nDuring this period, Boston flourished
        culturally, as well, admired for its rarefied literary life and generous artistic
        patronage, with members of old Boston families\u2014eventually dubbed Boston
        Brahmins\u2014coming to be regarded as the nation''s social and cultural elites.Boston
        was an early port of the Atlantic triangular slave trade in the New England
        colonies, but was soon overtaken by Salem, Massachusetts and Newport, Rhode
        Island. Boston eventually became a center of the abolitionist movement. The
        city reacted strongly to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, contributing to President
        Franklin Pierce''s attempt to make an example of Boston after the Anthony
        Burns Fugitive Slave Case.In 1822, the citizens of Boston voted to change
        the official name from the \"Town of Boston\" to the \"City of Boston\", and
        on March 19, 1822, the people of Boston accepted the charter incorporating
        the City. At the time Boston was chartered as a city, the population was about
        46,226, while the area of the city was only 4.7 square miles (12 km2).\n\n\n===
        19th century ===\n\nIn the 1820s, Boston''s population grew rapidly, and the
        city''s ethnic composition changed dramatically with the first wave of European
        immigrants. Irish immigrants dominated the first wave of newcomers during
        this period, especially following the Irish Potato Famine; by 1850, about
        35,000 Irish lived in Boston. In the latter half of the 19th century, the
        city saw increasing numbers of Irish, Germans, Lebanese, Syrians, French Canadians,
        and Russian and Polish Jews settling in the city. By the end of the 19th century,
        Boston''s core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants
        with their residence yielding lasting cultural change. Italians became the
        largest inhabitants of the North End, Irish dominated South Boston and Charlestown,
        and Russian Jews lived in the West End. Irish and Italian immigrants brought
        with them Roman Catholicism. Currently, Catholics make up Boston''s largest
        religious community, and the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics
        since the early 20th century; prominent figures include the Kennedys, Tip
        O''Neill, and John F. Fitzgerald.Between 1631 and 1890, the city tripled its
        area through land reclamation by filling in marshes, mud flats, and gaps between
        wharves along the waterfront. The largest reclamation efforts took place during
        the 19th century; beginning in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to
        fill in a 50-acre (20 ha) mill pond that later became the Haymarket Square
        area. The present-day State House sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill. Reclamation
        projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of the South
        End, the West End, the Financial District, and Chinatown.\n\nAfter the Great
        Boston fire of 1872, workers used building rubble as landfill along the downtown
        waterfront. During the mid-to-late 19th century, workers filled almost 600
        acres (2.4 km2) of brackish Charles River marshlands west of Boston Common
        with gravel brought by rail from the hills of Needham Heights. The city annexed
        the adjacent towns of South Boston (1804), East Boston (1836), Roxbury (1868),
        Dorchester (including present-day Mattapan and a portion of South Boston)
        (1870), Brighton (including present-day Allston) (1874), West Roxbury (including
        present-day Jamaica Plain and Roslindale) (1874), Charlestown (1874), and
        Hyde Park (1912). Other proposals were unsuccessful for the annexation of
        Brookline, Cambridge, and Chelsea.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nBoston went
        into decline by the early to mid-20th century, as factories became old and
        obsolete and businesses moved out of the region for cheaper labor elsewhere.
        Boston responded by initiating various urban renewal projects, under the direction
        of the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) established in 1957. In 1958,
        BRA initiated a project to improve the historic West End neighborhood. Extensive
        demolition was met with strong public opposition.The BRA subsequently re-evaluated
        its approach to urban renewal in its future projects, including the construction
        of the Government Center. In 1965, the Columbia Point Health Center opened
        in the Dorchester neighborhood, the first Community Health Center in the United
        States. It mostly served the massive Columbia Point public housing complex
        adjoining it, which was built in 1953. The health center is still in operation
        and was rededicated in 1990 as the Geiger-Gibson Community Health Center.
        The Columbia Point complex itself was redeveloped and revitalized from 1984
        to 1990 into a mixed-income residential development called Harbor Point Apartments.By
        the 1970s, the city''s economy had recovered after 30 years of economic downturn.
        A large number of high-rises were constructed in the Financial District and
        in Boston''s Back Bay during this period. This boom continued into the mid-1980s
        and resumed after a few pauses. Hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital,
        Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Brigham and Women''s Hospital lead
        the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Schools such as Boston
        College, Boston University, the Harvard Medical School, Tufts University School
        of Medicine, Northeastern University, Massachusetts College of Art and Design,
        Wentworth Institute of Technology, Berklee College of Music, and the Boston
        Conservatory attract students to the area. Nevertheless, the city experienced
        conflict starting in 1974 over desegregation busing, which resulted in unrest
        and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s.\n\n\n=== 21st
        century ===\n\nBoston is an intellectual, technological, and political center
        but has lost some important regional institutions, including the loss to mergers
        and acquisitions of local financial institutions such as FleetBoston Financial,
        which was acquired by Charlotte-based Bank of America in 2004. Boston-based
        department stores Jordan Marsh and Filene''s have both merged into the Cincinnati\u2013based
        Macy''s.\nThe 1993 acquisition of The Boston Globe by The New York Times was
        reversed in 2013 when it was re-sold to Boston businessman John W. Henry.
        In 2016, it was announced General Electric would be moving its corporate headquarters
        from Connecticut to the Innovation District in South Boston, joining many
        other companies in this rapidly developing neighborhood.\nBoston has experienced
        gentrification in the latter half of the 20th century, with housing prices
        increasing sharply since the 1990s. Living expenses have risen; Boston has
        one of the highest costs of living in the United States and was ranked the
        129th-most expensive major city in the world in a 2011 survey of 214 cities.
        Despite cost-of-living issues, Boston ranks high on livability ratings, ranking
        36th worldwide in quality of living in 2011 in a survey of 221 major cities.On
        April 15, 2013, two Chechen Islamist brothers detonated a pair of bombs near
        the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring
        roughly 264.In 2016, Boston briefly shouldered a bid as the US applicant for
        the 2024 Summer Olympics. The bid was supported by the mayor and a coalition
        of business leaders and local philanthropists, but was eventually dropped
        due to public opposition. The USOC then selected Los Angeles to be the American
        candidate with Los Angeles ultimately securing the right to host the 2028
        Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBoston has an area of 89.63 square
        miles (232.1 km2)\u201448.4 square miles (125.4 km2) (54%) of land and 41.2
        square miles (106.7 km2) (46%) of water. The city''s official elevation, as
        measured at Logan International Airport, is 19 ft (5.8 m) above sea level.
        The highest point in Boston is Bellevue Hill at 330 feet (100 m) above sea
        level, and the lowest point is at sea level. Situated onshore of the Atlantic
        Ocean, Boston is the only state capital in the contiguous United States with
        an oceanic shoreline.\nThe geographical center of Boston is in Roxbury. Due
        north of the center we find the South End. This is not to be confused with
        South Boston which lies directly east from the South End. North of South Boston
        is East Boston and southwest of East Boston is the North End.\n\nBoston is
        surrounded by the \"Greater Boston\" region and is contiguously bordered by
        the cities and towns of Winthrop, Revere, Chelsea, Everett, Somerville, Cambridge,
        Watertown, Newton, Brookline, Needham, Dedham, Canton, Milton, and Quincy.
        The Charles River separates Boston from Watertown and the majority of Cambridge,
        and the mass of Boston from its own Charlestown neighborhood. To the east
        lie Boston Harbor and the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (which
        includes part of the city''s territory, specifically Calf Island, Gallops
        Island, Great Brewster Island, Green Island, Little Brewster Island, Little
        Calf Island, Long Island, Lovells Island, Middle Brewster Island, Nixes Mate,
        Outer Brewster Island, Rainsford Island, Shag Rocks, Spectacle Island, The
        Graves, and Thompson Island). The Neponset River forms the boundary between
        Boston''s southern neighborhoods and the city of Quincy and the town of Milton.
        The Mystic River separates Charlestown from Chelsea and Everett, and Chelsea
        Creek and Boston Harbor separate East Boston from Downtown, the North End,
        and the Seaport.\n\n\n=== Cityscapes ===\n\n \n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nBoston
        is sometimes called a \"city of neighborhoods\" because of the profusion of
        diverse subsections; the city government''s Office of Neighborhood Services
        has officially designated 23 neighborhoods. More than two-thirds of inner
        Boston''s modern land area did not exist when the city was founded. Instead,
        it was created via the gradual filling in of the surrounding tidal areas over
        the centuries, with earth from leveling or lowering Boston''s three original
        hills (the \"Trimountain\", after which Tremont Street is named) and with
        gravel brought by train from Needham to fill the Back Bay.Downtown and its
        immediate surroundings consist largely of low-rise masonry buildings (often
        Federal style and Greek Revival) interspersed with modern highrises, in the
        Financial District, Government Center, and South Boston. Back Bay includes
        many prominent landmarks, such as the Boston Public Library, Christian Science
        Center, Copley Square, Newbury Street, and New England''s two tallest buildings:
        the John Hancock Tower and the Prudential Center.\nNear the John Hancock Tower
        is the old John Hancock Building with its prominent illuminated beacon, the
        color of which forecasts the weather. Smaller commercial areas are interspersed
        among areas of single-family homes and wooden/brick multi-family row houses.
        The South End Historic District is the largest surviving contiguous Victorian-era
        neighborhood in the US. The geography of downtown and South Boston was particularly
        affected by the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (known unofficially as the \"Big
        Dig\") which removed the unsightly elevated Central Artery and incorporated
        new green spaces and open areas.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen
        climate classification, depending on the isotherm used, Boston has either
        a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) under the \u22123 \u00b0C (26.6
        \u00b0F) isotherm or a humid continental climate under the 0 \u00b0C isotherm
        (K\u00f6ppen Dfa). The city is best described as being in a transitional zone
        between the two climates. Summers are typically warm and humid, while winters
        are cold and stormy, with occasional periods of heavy snow. Spring and fall
        are usually cool to mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction
        and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize
        the influence of the Atlantic Ocean. However, in winter areas near the immediate
        coast will often see more rain than snow as warm air is drawn off the Atlantic
        at times. The city lies at the transition between USDA plant hardiness zones
        6b (most of the city) and 7a (Downtown, South Boston, and East Boston neighborhoods).The
        hottest month is July, with a mean temperature of 73.4 \u00b0F (23.0 \u00b0C).
        The coldest month is January, with a mean of 29.0 \u00b0F (\u22121.7 \u00b0C).
        Periods exceeding 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) in summer and below freezing in
        winter are not uncommon but rarely extended, with about 13 and 25 days per
        year seeing each, respectively. The most recent sub-0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C)
        reading occurred on January 7, 2018, when the temperature dipped down to \u22122
        \u00b0F (\u221219 \u00b0C). In addition, several decades may pass between
        100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) readings, with the most recent such occurrence on
        July 22, 2011, when the temperature reached 103 \u00b0F (39 \u00b0C). The
        city''s average window for freezing temperatures is November 9 through April
        5. Official temperature records have ranged from \u221218 \u00b0F (\u221228
        \u00b0C) on February 9, 1934, up to 104 \u00b0F (40 \u00b0C) on July 4, 1911.
        The record cold daily maximum is 2 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C) on December
        30, 1917 while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 83 \u00b0F (28
        \u00b0C) on August 2, 1975 and July 21, 2019.\n\nBoston''s coastal location
        on the North Atlantic moderates its temperature but makes the city very prone
        to Nor''easter weather systems that can produce much snow and rain. The city
        averages 43.8 inches (1,110 mm) of precipitation a year, with 43.8 inches
        (111 cm) of snowfall per season. Snowfall increases dramatically as one goes
        inland away from the city (especially north and west of the city)\u2014away
        from the moderating influence of the ocean. Most snowfall occurs from mid-November
        through early April, and snow is rare in May and October. There is also high
        year-to-year variability in snowfall; for instance, the winter of 2011\u201312
        saw only 9.3 in (23.6 cm) of accumulating snow, but the previous winter, the
        corresponding figure was 81.0 in (2.06 m).Fog is fairly common, particularly
        in spring and early summer. Due to its location along the North Atlantic,
        the city often receives sea breezes, especially in the late spring, when water
        temperatures are still quite cold and temperatures at the coast can be more
        than 20 \u00b0F (11 \u00b0C) colder than a few miles inland, sometimes dropping
        by that amount near midday.\nThunderstorms occur from May to September, that
        are occasionally severe with large hail, damaging winds and heavy downpours.
        Although downtown Boston has never been struck by a violent tornado, the city
        itself has experienced many tornado warnings. Damaging storms are more common
        to areas north, west, and northwest of the city. Boston has a relatively sunny
        climate for a coastal city at its latitude, averaging over 2,600 hours of
        sunshine per annum.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn 2016, Boston was estimated
        to have 673,184 residents (a density of 13,841 persons/sq mi, or 5,344/km2)
        living in 272,481 housing units\u2014a 9% population increase over 2010. The
        city is the third-most densely populated large U.S. city of over half a million
        residents. Some 1.2 million persons may be within Boston''s boundaries during
        work hours, and as many as 2 million during special events. This fluctuation
        of people is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel
        to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.In the city,
        the population was spread out with 21.9% at age 19 and under, 14.3% from 20
        to 24, 33.2% from 25 to 44, 20.4% from 45 to 64, and 10.1% who were 65 years
        of age or older. The median age was 30.8 years. For every 100 females, there
        were 92.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.9 males.
        There were 252,699 households, of which 20.4% had children under the age of
        18 living in them, 25.5% were married couples living together, 16.3% had a
        female householder with no husband present, and 54.0% were non-families. 37.1%
        of all households were made up of individuals and 9.0% had someone living
        alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.26
        and the average family size was 3.08. Boston has one of the largest LGBT populations
        in the United States.\nThe median household income in Boston was $51,739,
        while the median income for a family was $61,035. Full-time year-round male
        workers had a median income of $52,544 versus $46,540 for full-time year-round
        female workers. The per capita income for the city was $33,158. 21.4% of the
        population and 16.0% of families are below the poverty line. Of the total
        population, 28.8% of those under the age of 18 and 20.4% of those 65 and older
        were living below the poverty line.In 1950, Whites represented 94.7% of Boston''s
        population. From the 1950s to the end of the 20th century, the proportion
        of non-Hispanic whites in the city declined. In 2000, non-Hispanic whites
        made up 49.5% of the city''s population, making the city majority minority
        for the first time. However, in the 21st century, the city has experienced
        significant gentrification, during which affluent whites have moved into formerly
        non-white areas. In 2006, the US Census Bureau estimated non-Hispanic whites
        again formed a slight majority but as of 2010, in part due to the housing
        crash, as well as increased efforts to make more affordable housing more available,
        the non-white population has rebounded. This may also have to do with increased
        Latin American and Asian populations and more clarity surrounding US Census
        statistics, which indicate a non-Hispanic white population of 47 percent (some
        reports give slightly lower figures).\n\nPeople of Irish descent form the
        largest single ethnic group in the city, making up 15.8% of the population,
        followed by Italians, accounting for 8.3% of the population. People of West
        Indian and Caribbean ancestry are another sizable group, at 6.0%, about half
        of whom are of Haitian ancestry. Over 27,000 Chinese Americans made their
        home in Boston city proper in 2013, and the city hosts a growing Chinatown
        accommodating heavily traveled Chinese-owned bus lines to and from Chinatown,
        Manhattan in New York City. Some neighborhoods, such as Dorchester, have received
        an influx of people of Vietnamese ancestry in recent decades. Neighborhoods
        such as Jamaica Plain and Roslindale have experienced a growing number of
        Dominican Americans. The city and greater area also has a growing immigrant
        population of South Asians, including the tenth-largest Indian population
        in the country.\nThe city, especially the East Boston neighborhood, has a
        significant Hispanic population. In 2010, Hispanics in Boston were mostly
        of Puerto Rican (30,506 or 4.9% of total city population), Dominican (25,648
        or 4.2% of total city population), Salvadoran (10,850 or 1.8% of city population),
        Colombian (6,649 or 1.1% of total city population), Mexican (5,961 or 1.0%
        of total city population), and Guatemalan (4,451 or 0.7% of total city population)
        ethnic origin. Hispanics of all national origins totaled 107,917 in 2010.
        In Greater Boston, these numbers grew significantly, with Puerto Ricans numbering
        175,000+, Dominicans 95,000+, Salvadorans 40,000+, Guatemalans 31,000+, Mexicans
        25,000+, and Colombians numbering 22,000+.\n\n\n=== Ancestry ===\nAccording
        to the 2012\u20132016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, the largest
        ancestry groups in Boston, Massachusetts are:\n\n\n=== Demographic breakdown
        by ZIP Code ===\n\n\n==== Income ====\n\nData is from the 2008\u20132012 American
        Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to a
        2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 57% of the population of the city identified
        themselves as Christians, with 25% attending a variety of Protestant churches
        and 29% professing Roman Catholic beliefs; 33% claim no religious affiliation,
        while the remaining 10% are made up of adherents of Judaism, Buddhism, Islam,
        Hinduism and other faiths.\nAs of 2010, the Catholic Church had the highest
        number of adherents as a single denomination in the Boston-Cambridge-Newton
        Metro area, with more than two million members and 339 churches, followed
        by the Episcopal Church with 58,000 adherents in 160 churches. The United
        Church of Christ had 55,000 members and 213 churches. The UCC is the successor
        of the city''s Puritan religious traditions. Old South Church in Boston is
        one of the oldest congregations in the United States. It was organized in
        1669 by dissenters from the First Church in Boston (1630). Past members include
        Samuel Adams, William Dawes, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Sewall, and Phillis
        Wheatley. In 1773, Adams gave the signals from the Old South Meeting House
        that started the Boston Tea Party.\nThe city has a Jewish population of an
        estimated 248,000 Jews within the Boston metro area. More than half of Jewish
        households in the Greater Boston area reside in the city itself, Brookline,
        Newton, Cambridge, Somerville, or adjacent towns.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nA
        global city, Boston is placed among the top 30 most economically powerful
        cities in the world.  With a sturdy foundation of education and health care,
        and a jobless rate that is frequently below the national average, Boston''s
        economy has been on solid ground for quite some time. Encompassing $363 billion,
        the Greater Boston metropolitan area has the sixth-largest economy in the
        country and 12th-largest in the world.Boston''s colleges and universities
        exert a significant impact on the regional economy. Boston attracts more than
        350,000 college students from around the world, who contribute more than US$4.8
        billion annually to the city''s economy. The area''s schools are major employers
        and attract industries to the city and surrounding region. The city is home
        to a number of technology companies and is a hub for biotechnology, with the
        Milken Institute rating Boston as the top life sciences cluster in the country.
        Boston receives the highest absolute amount of annual funding from the National
        Institutes of Health of all cities in the United States.The city is considered
        highly innovative for a variety of reasons, including the presence of academia,
        access to venture capital, and the presence of many high-tech companies. The
        Route 128 corridor and Greater Boston continue to be a major center for venture
        capital investment, and high technology remains an important sector.\nTourism
        also composes a large part of Boston''s economy, with 21.2 million domestic
        and international visitors spending $8.3 billion in 2011. Excluding visitors
        from Canada and Mexico, over 1.4 million international tourists visited Boston
        in 2014, with those from China and the United Kingdom leading the list. Boston''s
        status as a state capital as well as the regional home of federal agencies
        has rendered law and government to be another major component of the city''s
        economy. The city is a major seaport along the East Coast of the United States
        and the oldest continuously operated industrial and fishing port in the Western
        Hemisphere.The financial services industry is important to Boston, especially
        involving mutual funds and insurance. In the 2018 Global Financial Centres
        Index, Boston was ranked as having the thirteenth most competitive financial
        center in the world and the second most competitive in the United States.
        Boston-based Fidelity Investments helped popularize the mutual fund in the
        1980s and has made Boston one of the top financial centers in the United States.
        The city is home to the headquarters of Santander Bank, and Boston is a center
        for venture capital firms. State Street Corporation, which specializes in
        asset management and custody services, is based in the city. Boston is a printing
        and publishing center\u2014Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is headquartered within
        the city, along with Bedford-St. Martin''s Press and Beacon Press. Pearson
        PLC publishing units also employ several hundred people in Boston. The city
        is home to three major convention centers\u2014the Hynes Convention Center
        in the Back Bay, and the Seaport World Trade Center and Boston Convention
        and Exhibition Center on the South Boston waterfront. The General Electric
        Corporation announced in January 2016 its decision to move the company''s
        global headquarters to the Seaport District in Boston, from Fairfield, Connecticut,
        citing factors including Boston''s preeminence in the realm of higher education.
        Boston is home to the headquarters of several major athletic and footwear
        companies including Converse, New Balance, and Reebok. Rockport, Puma and
        Wolverine World Wide, Inc. headquarters or regional offices are just outside
        the city.In 2019, a yearly ranking of time wasted in traffic listed Boston
        area drivers lost approximately 164 hours a year in lost productivity due
        to the area''s traffic congestion. This amounted to $2,300 a year per driver
        in costs.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\n\nThe
        Boston Public Schools enroll 57,000 students attending 145 schools, including
        the renowned Boston Latin Academy, John D. O''Bryant School of Math & Science,
        and Boston Latin School. The Boston Latin School was established in 1635 and
        is the oldest public high school in the US. Boston also operates the United
        States'' second-oldest public high school and its oldest public elementary
        school. The system''s students are 40% Hispanic or Latino, 35% Black or African
        American, 13% White, and 9% Asian. There are private, parochial, and charter
        schools as well, and approximately 3,300 minority students attend participating
        suburban schools through the Metropolitan Educational Opportunity Council.
        In September 2019, the city formally inaugurated Boston Saves, a program that
        provides every child enrolled in the city''s kindergarten system a savings
        account containing $50 to be used toward college or career training.\n\n\n===
        Higher education ===\n\nSome of the most renowned and highly ranked universities
        in the world are near Boston. Three universities with a major presence in
        the city, Harvard, MIT, and Tufts, are just outside of Boston in the cities
        of Cambridge and Somerville, known as the Brainpower Triangle. Harvard is
        the nation''s oldest institute of higher education and is centered across
        the Charles River in Cambridge, though the majority of its land holdings and
        a substantial amount of its educational activities are in Boston. Its business,
        medical, dental, and public health schools are in Boston''s Allston and Longwood
        neighborhoods, and Harvard plans to expand into Allston.The Massachusetts
        Institute of Technology (MIT) originated in Boston and was long known as \"Boston
        Tech\"; it moved across the river to Cambridge in 1916. Tufts University''s
        main campus is north of the city in Somerville and Medford, though it locates
        its medical and dental schools in Boston''s Chinatown at Tufts Medical Center,
        a 451-bed academic medical institution that is home to a full-service hospital
        for adults and the Floating Hospital for Children.Four members of the Association
        of American Universities are in Greater Boston (more than any other metropolitan
        area): Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston
        University, and Brandeis University. Furthermore, Greater Boston contains
        seven Highest Research Activity (R1) Universities as per the Carnegie Classification.
        This includes, in addition to the aforementioned four, Boston College, Northeastern
        University, and Tufts University. This is, by a large margin, the highest
        concentration of such institutions in a single metropolitan area.\nHospitals,
        universities, and research institutions in Greater Boston received more than
        $1.77 billion in National Institutes of Health grants in 2013, more money
        than any other American metropolitan area.Greater Boston has more than 100
        colleges and universities, with 250,000 students enrolled in Boston and Cambridge
        alone. The city''s largest private universities include Boston University
        (also the city''s fourth-largest employer), with its main campus along Commonwealth
        Avenue and a medical campus in the South End, Northeastern University in the
        Fenway area, Suffolk University near Beacon Hill, which includes law school
        and business school, and Boston College, which straddles the Boston (Brighton)\u2013Newton
        border. Boston''s only public university is the University of Massachusetts
        Boston on Columbia Point in Dorchester. Roxbury Community College and Bunker
        Hill Community College are the city''s two public community colleges. Altogether,
        Boston''s colleges and universities employ more than 42,600 people, accounting
        for nearly seven percent of the city''s workforce.Smaller private colleges
        include Babson College, Bentley University, Boston Architectural College,
        Emmanuel College, Fisher College, MGH Institute of Health Professions, Massachusetts
        College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Simmons College, Wellesley College,
        Wheelock College, Wentworth Institute of Technology, New England School of
        Law (originally established as America''s first all female law school), and
        Emerson College.Metropolitan Boston is home to several conservatories and
        art schools, including Lesley University College of Art and Design, Massachusetts
        College of Art, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, New England Institute
        of Art, New England School of Art and Design (Suffolk University), Longy School
        of Music of Bard College, and the New England Conservatory (the oldest independent
        conservatory in the United States). Other conservatories include the Boston
        Conservatory and Berklee College of Music, which has made Boston an important
        city for jazz music.\n\n\n== Public safety ==\n\nLike many major American
        cities, Boston has seen a great reduction in violent crime since the early
        1990s. Boston''s low crime rate since the 1990s has been credited to the Boston
        Police Department''s collaboration with neighborhood groups and church parishes
        to prevent youths from joining gangs, as well as involvement from the United
        States Attorney and District Attorney''s offices. This helped lead in part
        to what has been touted as the \"Boston Miracle\". Murders in the city dropped
        from 152 in 1990 (for a murder rate of 26.5 per 100,000 people) to just 31\u2014not
        one of them a juvenile\u2014in 1999 (for a murder rate of 5.26 per 100,000).In
        2008, there were 62 reported homicides. Through December 30, 2016, major crime
        was down seven percent and there were 46 homicides compared to 40 in 2015.\n\n\n==
        Culture ==\n\nBoston shares many cultural roots with greater New England,
        including a dialect of the non-rhotic Eastern New England accent known as
        the Boston accent and a regional cuisine with a large emphasis on seafood,
        salt, and dairy products. Boston also has its own collection of neologisms
        known as Boston slang and sardonic humor.In the early 1800s, William Tudor
        wrote that Boston was \"''perhaps the most perfect and certainly the best-regulated
        democracy that ever existed. There is something so impossible in the immortal
        fame of Athens, that the very name makes everything modern shrink from comparison;
        but since the days of that glorious city I know of none that has approached
        so near in some points, distant as it may still be from that illustrious model.''
        From this, Boston has been called the \"Athens of America\" (also a nickname
        of Philadelphia) for its literary culture, earning a reputation as \"the intellectual
        capital of the United States.\"In the nineteenth century, Ralph Waldo Emerson,
        Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Margaret Fuller, James Russell Lowell,
        and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote in Boston. Some consider the Old Corner
        Bookstore to be the \"cradle of American literature,\" the place where these
        writers met and where The Atlantic Monthly was first published. In 1852, the
        Boston Public Library was founded as the first free library in the United
        States. Boston''s literary culture continues today thanks to the city''s many
        universities and the Boston Book Festival.\nMusic is afforded a high degree
        of civic support in Boston. The Boston Symphony Orchestra is one of the \"Big
        Five,\" a group of the greatest American orchestras, and the classical music
        magazine Gramophone called it one of the \"world''s best\" orchestras. Symphony
        Hall (west of Back Bay) is home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the related
        Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra, which is the largest youth orchestra in the
        nation, and to the Boston Pops Orchestra. The British newspaper The Guardian
        called Boston Symphony Hall \"one of the top venues for classical music in
        the world,\" adding \"Symphony Hall in Boston was where science became an
        essential part of concert hall design.\" Other concerts are held at the New
        England Conservatory''s Jordan Hall. The Boston Ballet performs at the Boston
        Opera House. Other performing-arts organizations in the city include the Boston
        Lyric Opera Company, Opera Boston, Boston Baroque (the first permanent Baroque
        orchestra in the US), and the Handel and Haydn Society (one of the oldest
        choral companies in the United States). The city is a center for contemporary
        classical music with a number of performing groups, several of which are associated
        with the city''s conservatories and universities. These include the Boston
        Modern Orchestra Project and Boston Musica Viva. Several theaters are in or
        near the Theater District south of Boston Common, including the Cutler Majestic
        Theatre, Citi Performing Arts Center, the Colonial Theater, and the Orpheum
        Theatre.\n\nThere are several major annual events, such as First Night which
        occurs on New Year''s Eve, the Boston Early Music Festival, the annual Boston
        Arts Festival at Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park, the annual Boston gay
        pride parade and festival held in June, and Italian summer feasts in the North
        End honoring Catholic saints. The city is the site of several events during
        the Fourth of July period. They include the week-long Harborfest festivities
        and a Boston Pops concert accompanied by fireworks on the banks of the Charles
        River.Several historic sites relating to the American Revolution period are
        preserved as part of the Boston National Historical Park because of the city''s
        prominent role. Many are found along the Freedom Trail, which is marked by
        a red line of bricks embedded in the ground.\nThe city is also home to several
        art museums and galleries, including the Museum of Fine Arts and the Isabella
        Stewart Gardner Museum. The Institute of Contemporary Art is housed in a contemporary
        building designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro in the Seaport District. Boston''s
        South End Art and Design District (SoWa) and Newbury St. are both art gallery
        destinations. Columbia Point is the location of the University of Massachusetts
        Boston, the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, the
        John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, and the Massachusetts Archives
        and Commonwealth Museum. The Boston Athen\u00e6um (one of the oldest independent
        libraries in the United States), Boston Children''s Museum, Bull & Finch Pub
        (whose building is known from the television show Cheers), Museum of Science,
        and the New England Aquarium are within the city.\nBoston has been a noted
        religious center from its earliest days. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
        Boston serves nearly 300 parishes and is based in the Cathedral of the Holy
        Cross (1875) in the South End, while the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts
        serves just under 200 congregations, with the Cathedral Church of St. Paul
        (1819) as its episcopal seat. Unitarian Universalism has its headquarters
        on Beacon Hill. The Christian Scientists are headquartered in Back Bay at
        the Mother Church (1894). The oldest church in Boston is First Church in Boston,
        founded in 1630. King''s Chapel was the city''s first Anglican church, founded
        in 1686 and converted to Unitarianism in 1785. Other churches include Christ
        Church (better known as Old North Church, 1723), the oldest church building
        in the city, Trinity Church (1733), Park Street Church (1809), Old South Church
        (1874), Jubilee Christian Church, and Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual
        Help on Mission Hill (1878).\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\n\n=== Pollution control
        ===\nAir quality in Boston is generally very good. Between 2004\u20132013,
        there were only four days in which the air was unhealthy for the general public,
        according to the EPA.Some of the cleaner energy facilities in Boston include
        the Allston green district, with three ecologically compatible housing facilities.
        Boston is also breaking ground on multiple green affordable housing facilities
        to help reduce the carbon impact of the city while simultaneously making these
        initiatives financially available to a greater population. Boston''s climate
        plan is updated every three years and was most recently modified in 2013.
        This legislature includes the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance,
        which requires the city''s larger buildings to disclose their yearly energy
        and water use statistics and to partake in an energy assessment every five
        years. These statistics are made public by the city, thereby increasing incentives
        for buildings to be more environmentally conscious.Mayor Thomas Menino introduced
        the Renew Boston Whole Building Incentive which reduces the cost of living
        in buildings that are deemed energy efficient. This gives people an opportunity
        to find housing in neighborhoods that support the environment. The ultimate
        goal of this initiative is to enlist 500 Bostonians to participate in a free,
        in-home energy assessment.\n\n\n=== Water purity and availability ===\nMany
        older buildings in certain areas of Boston are supported by wooden piles driven
        into the area''s fill; these piles remain sound if submerged in water, but
        are subject to dry rot if exposed to air for long periods.\nGround water levels
        have been dropping in many areas of the city, due in part to an increase in
        the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed
        by the ground. The Boston Groundwater Trust coordinates monitoring ground
        water levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring
        wells. However, Boston''s drinking water supply from the Quabbin and Wachusett
        Reservoirs is one of the very few in the country so pure as to satisfy the
        Federal Clean Water Act without filtration.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nBoston has
        teams in the four major North American professional sports leagues plus Major
        League Soccer, and, as of 2019, has won 39 championships in these leagues.
        It is one of six cities (along with Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York
        and Philadelphia) to have won championships in all four major sports. It has
        been suggested that Boston is the new \"TitleTown, USA\", as the city''s professional
        sports teams have won twelve championships since 2001: Patriots (2001, 2003,
        2004, 2014, 2016 and 2018), Red Sox (2004, 2007, 2013, and 2018), Celtics
        (2008), and Bruins (2011). This love of sports made Boston the United States
        Olympic Committee''s choice to bid to hold the 2024 Summer Olympic Games,
        but the city cited financial concerns when it withdrew its bid on July 27,
        2015.The Boston Red Sox, a founding member of the American League of Major
        League Baseball in 1901, play their home games at Fenway Park, near Kenmore
        Square, in the city''s Fenway section. Built in 1912, it is the oldest sports
        arena or stadium in active use in the United States among the four major professional
        American sports leagues, Major League Baseball, the National Football League,
        National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League. Boston was
        the site of the first game of the first modern World Series, in 1903. The
        series was played between the AL Champion Boston Americans and the NL champion
        Pittsburgh Pirates. Persistent reports that the team was known in 1903 as
        the \"Boston Pilgrims\" appear to be unfounded. Boston''s first professional
        baseball team was the Red Stockings, one of the charter members of the National
        Association in 1871, and of the National League in 1876. The team played under
        that name until 1883, under the name Beaneaters until 1911, and under the
        name Braves from 1912 until they moved to Milwaukee after the 1952 season.
        Since 1966 they have played in Atlanta as the Atlanta Braves.\n\nThe TD Garden,
        formerly called the FleetCenter and built to replace the old, since-demolished
        Boston Garden, is adjoined to North Station and is the home of two major league
        teams: the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League and the Boston Celtics
        of the National Basketball Association. The arena seats 18,624 for basketball
        games and 17,565 for ice hockey games. The Bruins were the first American
        member of the National Hockey League and an Original Six franchise. The Boston
        Celtics were founding members of the Basketball Association of America, one
        of the two leagues that merged to form the NBA. The Celtics have the distinction
        of having won more championships than any other NBA team, with seventeen.While
        they have played in suburban Foxborough since 1971, the New England Patriots
        of the National Football League were founded in 1960 as the Boston Patriots,
        changing their name after relocating. The team won the Super Bowl after the
        2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016 and 2018 seasons. They share Gillette Stadium
        with the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer. The Boston Breakers
        of Women''s Professional Soccer, which formed in 2009, play their home games
        at Dilboy Stadium in Somerville. The Boston Storm of the United Women''s Lacrosse
        League was formed in 2015.\n\nThe area''s many colleges and universities are
        active in college athletics. Four NCAA Division I members play in the area\u2014Boston
        College, Boston University, Harvard University, and Northeastern University.
        Of the four, only Boston College participates in college football at the highest
        level, the Football Bowl Subdivision. Harvard participates in the second-highest
        level, the Football Championship Subdivision. The Boston Cannons of the MLL
        play at Harvard Stadium.\nOne of the best known sporting events in the city
        is the Boston Marathon, the 26.2-mile (42.2 km) race which is the world''s
        oldest annual marathon, run on Patriots'' Day in April. On April 15, 2013,
        two explosions killed three people and injured hundreds at the marathon.\nAnother
        major annual event is the Head of the Charles Regatta, held in October.\n\n\n==
        Parks and recreation ==\n\nBoston Common, near the Financial District and
        Beacon Hill, is the oldest public park in the United States. Along with the
        adjacent Boston Public Garden, it is part of the Emerald Necklace, a string
        of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted to encircle the city. The Emerald
        Necklace includes Jamaica Pond, Boston''s largest body of freshwater, and
        Franklin Park, the city''s largest park and home of the Franklin Park Zoo.
        Another major park is the Esplanade, along the banks of the Charles River.
        The Hatch Shell, an outdoor concert venue, is adjacent to the Charles River
        Esplanade. Other parks are scattered throughout the city, with major parks
        and beaches near Castle Island, in Charlestown and along the Dorchester, South
        Boston, and East Boston shorelines.Boston''s park system is well-reputed nationally.
        In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land reported Boston was
        tied with Sacramento and San Francisco for having the third-best park system
        among the 50 most populous US cities. ParkScore ranks city park systems by
        a formula that analyzes the city''s median park size, park acres as percent
        of city area, the percent of residents within a half-mile of a park, spending
        of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds per 10,000 residents.\n\n\n==
        Government and politics ==\n\nBoston has a strong mayor \u2013 council government
        system in which the mayor (elected every fourth year) has extensive executive
        power. Marty Walsh became Mayor in January 2014, his predecessor Thomas Menino''s
        twenty-year tenure having been the longest in the city''s history.\nThe Boston
        City Council is elected every two years; there are nine district seats, and
        four citywide \"at-large\" seats. The School Committee, which oversees the
        Boston Public Schools, is appointed by the mayor.In addition to city government,
        numerous commissions and state authorities\u2014including the Massachusetts
        Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Boston Public Health Commission,
        the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), and the Massachusetts
        Port Authority (Massport)\u2014play a role in the life of Bostonians. As the
        capital of Massachusetts, Boston plays a major role in state politics.\nThe
        city has several federal facilities, including the John F. Kennedy Federal
        Office Building, the Thomas P. O''Neill Jr. Federal Building, the John W.
        McCormack Post Office and Courthouse, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,
        the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and the United States
        District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Both courts are housed in
        the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse.\nFederally, Boston is split
        between two congressional districts. The northern three-fourths of the city
        is in the 7th district, represented by Ayanna Pressley. The southern fourth
        is in the 8th district, represented by Stephen Lynch. Both are Democrats;
        a Republican has not represented a significant portion of Boston in over a
        century. The state''s senior member of the United States Senate is Democrat
        Elizabeth Warren, first elected in 2012. The state''s junior member of the
        United States Senate is Democrat Ed Markey, who was elected in 2013 to succeed
        John Kerry after Kerry''s appointment and confirmation as the United States
        Secretary of State.\nThe city uses an algorithm created by the Walsh administration,
        called CityScore, to measure the effectiveness of various city services. This
        score is available on a public online dashboard and allows city managers in
        police, fire, schools, emergency management services, and 3-1-1 to take action
        and make adjustments in areas of concern.Boston has an ordinance, enacted
        in 2014, that bars the Boston Police Department \"from detaining anyone based
        on their immigration status unless they have a criminal warrant.\"\n\n\n==
        Media ==\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nThe Boston Globe and the Boston Herald are
        two of the city''s major daily newspapers. The city is also served by other
        publications such as Boston magazine, DigBoston, and the Boston edition of
        Metro. The Christian Science Monitor, headquartered in Boston, was formerly
        a worldwide daily newspaper but ended publication of daily print editions
        in 2009, switching to continuous online and weekly magazine format publications.
        The Boston Globe also releases a teen publication to the city''s public high
        schools, called Teens in Print or T.i.P., which is written by the city''s
        teens and delivered quarterly within the school year. The Improper Bostonian,
        a glossy lifestyle magazine, was published from 1991 through April 2019.\nThe
        city''s growing Latino population has given rise to a number of local and
        regional Spanish-language newspapers. These include El Planeta (owned by the
        former publisher of The Boston Phoenix), El Mundo, and La Semana. Siglo21,
        with its main offices in nearby Lawrence, is also widely distributed.There
        are a number of weekly newspapers dedicated to Boston neighborhoods. Among
        them is South Boston Online, founded in 1999, which appears in print and online,
        and covers events in South Boston and the Seaport District.\nVarious LGBT
        publications serve the city''s large LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender)
        population such as The Rainbow Times, the only minority and lesbian-owned
        LGBT news magazine. Founded in 2006, The Rainbow Times is now based out of
        Boston, but serves all of New England.\n\n\n=== Radio and television ===\nBoston
        is the largest broadcasting market in New England, with the radio market being
        the 9th largest in the United States. Several major AM stations include talk
        radio WRKO, sports/talk station WEEI, and CBS Radio WBZ. WBZ (AM) broadcasts
        a news radio format and is a 50,000 watt \"clear channel\" station, whose
        nighttime broadcasts are heard hundreds of miles from Boston.  A variety of
        commercial FM radio formats serve the area, as do NPR stations WBUR and WGBH.
        College and university radio stations include WERS (Emerson), WHRB (Harvard),
        WUMB (UMass Boston), WMBR (MIT), WZBC (Boston College), WMFO (Tufts University),
        WBRS (Brandeis University), WTBU (Boston University, campus and web only),
        WRBB (Northeastern University) and WMLN-FM (Curry College).\nThe Boston television
        DMA, which also includes Manchester, New Hampshire, is the 8th largest in
        the United States. The city is served by stations representing every major
        American network, including WBZ-TV 4 and its sister station WSBK-TV 38 (the
        former a CBS O&O, the latter a MyNetwork TV affiliate), WCVB-TV 5 and its
        sister station WMUR-TV 9 (both ABC), WHDH 7 and its sister station WLVI 56
        (the former an independent station, the latter a CW affiliate), WBTS-LD 8
        (a NBC O&O), and WFXT 25 (Fox). The city is also home to PBS member station
        WGBH-TV 2, a major producer of PBS programs, which also operates WGBX 44.
        Spanish-language television networks, including Azteca (WFXZ-CD 24), Univisi\u00f3n
        (WUNI 27), Telemundo (WNEU 60, a sister station to WBTS-LD), and UniM\u00e1s
        (WUTF-DT 66), have a presence in the region, with WNEU and WUTF serving as
        network owned-and-operated stations. Most of the area''s television stations
        have their transmitters in nearby Needham and Newton along the Route 128 corridor.
        Six Boston television stations are carried by Canadian satellite television
        provider Bell TV and by cable television providers in Canada.\n\n\n=== Film
        ===\n\nFilms have been made in Boston since as early as 1903, and it continues
        to be both a popular setting and a popular site for filming location.\n\n\n==
        Healthcare ==\n\nThe Longwood Medical and Academic Area, adjacent to the Fenway
        district, is home to a large number of medical and research facilities, including
        Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women''s Hospital, Boston
        Children''s Hospital, Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School,
        Joslin Diabetes Center, and the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health
        Sciences.\nProminent medical facilities, including Massachusetts General Hospital,
        Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital
        are in the Beacon Hill area. St. Elizabeth''s Medical Center is in Brighton
        Center of the city''s Brighton neighborhood. New England Baptist Hospital
        is in Mission Hill. The city has Veterans Affairs medical centers in the Jamaica
        Plain and West Roxbury neighborhoods. The Boston Public Health Commission,
        an agency of the Massachusetts government, oversees health concerns for city
        residents. Boston EMS provides pre-hospital emergency medical services to
        residents and visitors.\nMany of Boston''s medical facilities are associated
        with universities. The facilities in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area
        and in Massachusetts General Hospital are affiliated with Harvard Medical
        School. Tufts Medical Center (formerly Tufts-New England Medical Center),
        in the southern portion of the Chinatown neighborhood, is affiliated with
        Tufts University School of Medicine. Boston Medical Center, in the South End
        neighborhood, is the primary teaching facility for the Boston University School
        of Medicine as well as the largest trauma center in the Boston area; it was
        formed by the merger of Boston University Hospital and Boston City Hospital,
        which was the first municipal hospital in the United States.\n\n\n== Infrastructure
        ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nLogan Airport, in East Boston and operated
        by the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), is Boston''s principal airport.
        Nearby general aviation airports are Beverly Municipal Airport to the north,
        Hanscom Field to the west, and Norwood Memorial Airport to the south. Massport
        also operates several major facilities within the Port of Boston, including
        a cruise ship terminal and facilities to handle bulk and container cargo in
        South Boston, and other facilities in Charlestown and East Boston.Downtown
        Boston''s streets grew organically, so they do not form a planned grid, unlike
        those in later-developed Back Bay, East Boston, the South End, and South Boston.
        Boston is the eastern terminus of I-90, which in Massachusetts runs along
        the Massachusetts Turnpike. The elevated portion of the Central Artery, which
        carried most of the through traffic in downtown Boston, was replaced with
        the O''Neill Tunnel during the Big Dig, substantially completed in early 2006.  The
        former and current Central Artery follow I-93 as the primary north-south artery
        from the city.  Other major highways include US 1, which carries traffic to
        the North Shore and areas south of Boston, US 3, which connects to the northwestern
        suburbs, Massachusetts Route 3, which connects to the South Shore and Cape
        Cod, and Massachusetts Route 2 which connects to the western suburbs.  Surrounding
        the city is Massachusetts Route 128, a partial beltway which has been largely
        subsumed by other routes (mostly I-95 and I-93.\nWith nearly a third of Bostonians
        using public transit for their commute to work, Boston has the fifth-highest
        rate of public transit usage in the country. The city of Boston has a higher
        than average percentage of households without a car. In 2015, 35.4 percent
        of Boston households lacked a car, which decreased slightly to 33.8 percent
        in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Boston averaged 0.94
        cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8. Boston''s
        public transportation agency, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority
        (MBTA) operates the oldest underground rapid transit system in the Americas,
        and is the fourth-busiest rapid transit system in the country, with 65.5 miles
        (105 km) of track on four lines. The MBTA also operates busy bus and commuter
        rail networks, and water shuttles.\n\nAmtrak intercity rail to Boston is provided
        through four stations: South Station, North Station, Back Bay, and Route 128.
        South Station is a major intermodal transportation hub and is the terminus
        of Amtrak''s Northeast Regional, Acela Express, and Lake Shore Limited routes,
        in addition to multiple MBTA services. Back Bay is also served by MBTA and
        those three Amtrak routes, while Route 128, in the southwestern suburbs of
        Boston, is only served by the Acela Express and Northeast Regional. Meanwhile,
        Amtrak''s Downeaster to Brunswick terminates in North Station, and is the
        only Amtrak route to do so.Nicknamed \"The Walking City\", Boston hosts more
        pedestrian commuters than do other comparably populated cities. Owing to factors
        such as necessity, the compactness of the city and large student population,
        13 percent of the population commutes by foot, making it the highest percentage
        of pedestrian commuters in the country out of the major American cities. In
        2011, Walk Score ranked Boston the third most walkable city in the United
        States. As of 2015, Walk Score still ranks Boston as the third most walkable
        US city, with a Walk Score of 80, a Transit Score of 75, and a Bike Score
        of 70.Between 1999 and 2006, Bicycling magazine named Boston three times as
        one of the worst cities in the US for cycling; regardless, it has one of the
        highest rates of bicycle commuting. In 2008, as a consequence of improvements
        made to bicycling conditions within the city, the same magazine put Boston
        on its \"Five for the Future\" list as a \"Future Best City\" for biking,
        and Boston''s bicycle commuting percentage increased from 1% in 2000 to 2.1%
        in 2009. The bikeshare program called Hubway launched in late July 2011, logging
        more than 140,000 rides before the close of its first season. The neighboring
        municipalities of Cambridge, Somerville, and Brookline joined the Hubway program
        in the summer of 2012. In 2016, there are 1,461 bikes and 158 docking stations
        across the city. PBSC Urban Solutions provides bicycles and technology for
        this bike-sharing system.In 2013, the Boston-Cambridge-Newton metropolitan
        statistical area (Boston MSA) had the seventh-lowest percentage of workers
        who commuted by private automobile (75.6 percent), with 6.2 percent of area
        workers traveling via rail transit. During the period starting in 2006 and
        ending in 2013, the Boston MSA had the greatest percentage decline of workers
        commuting by automobile (3.3 percent) among MSAs with more than a half-million
        residents.\n\n\n== Twin towns and sister cities ==\n\nThe City of Boston has
        eleven official sister cities:\n Kyoto, Japan (1959)\n Strasbourg, France
        (1960)\n Barcelona, Spain (1980)\n Hangzhou, People''s Republic of China (1982)\n

        partnership relationships through a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) with
        four additional cities or regions:\n\n Guangzhou, People''s Republic of China
        (2014)\n Lyon, France (2016)\n Copenhagen, Denmark (2017)\n Mexico City, Mexico
        (2017)\nNorth West of Ireland, Ireland (2017)In 1900, Americans from Boston
        bought a piece of land in Bellville, Western Cape, South Africa and developed
        it for residential purposes. In memory of their hometown, they called it Boston.\n\n\n==
