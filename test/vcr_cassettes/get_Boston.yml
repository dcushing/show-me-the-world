        The British sent two regiments to Boston in 1768 in an attempt to quell the
        angry colonists. This did not bode well with the colonists. In 1770, during
        the [[Boston Massacre]], the army killed several people in response to a mob
        in Boston. The colonists compelled the British to withdraw their troops. The
        event was widely publicized and fueled a revolutionary movement in America.<ref

        of the colonists saw the act as an attempt to force them to accept the taxes
        established by the [[Townshend Acts]]. The act prompted the [[Boston Tea Party]],
        where a group of rebels threw an entire shipment of tea sent by the British
        [[East India Company]] into [[Boston Harbor]]. The Boston Tea Party was a
        key event leading up to the revolution, as the British government responded
        furiously with the [[Intolerable Acts]], demanding compensation for the lost
        tea from the rebels.<ref name=\"newamernation\" /> This angered the colonists

        British captured the [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown peninsula]] in Boston,
        during the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. The British army outnumbered the militia
        stationed there, but it was a [[Pyrrhic victory]] for the British because
        their army suffered devastating casualties. It was also a testament to the

        supply shortages in the siege, and the fighting was limited to small-scale
        raids and skirmishes. On March 4, 1776, Washington commanded his army to [[Fortification

        army placed cannons there to repel a British invasion against their stake

        Boston, but bad weather delayed their advance. Howe reconsidered his invasion,
        and decided to withdraw. British troops evacuated Boston on March 17, which

        had found alternatives for their capital investments in the interim. Manufacturing
        became an important component of the city''s economy, and the city''s industrial
        manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th

        and most populous municipality of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the
        United States. The city proper covers 48 square miles (124 km2) with an estimated
        population of 685,094 in 2017, making it also the most populous city in the
        New England region. Boston is the seat of Suffolk County as well, although
        the county government was disbanded on July 1, 1999. The city is the economic
        and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater
        Boston, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 4.8
        million people in 2016 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country.
        As a combined statistical area (CSA), this wider commuting region is home
        to some 8.2 million people, making it the sixth-largest in the United States.\nBoston
        is one of the oldest cities in the United States, founded on the Shawmut Peninsula
        in 1630 by Puritan settlers from England. It was the scene of several key
        events of the American Revolution, such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston
        Tea Party, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the Siege of Boston. Upon U.S. independence
        from Great Britain, it continued to be an important port and manufacturing
        hub as well as a center for education and culture. The city has expanded beyond
        the original peninsula through land reclamation and municipal annexation.
        Its rich history attracts many tourists, with Faneuil Hall alone drawing more
        than 20 million visitors per year. Boston''s many firsts include the United
        States'' first public or state school (Boston Latin School, 1635), first subway
        system (Tremont Street Subway, 1897), and first public park (Boston Common,
        1634).\nThe Boston area''s many colleges and universities make it an international
        center of higher education, including law, medicine, engineering, and business,
        and the city is considered to be a world leader in innovation and entrepreneurship,
        with nearly 2,000 start-ups. Boston''s economic base also includes finance,
        professional and business services, biotechnology, information technology,
        and government activities. Households in the city claim the highest average
        rate of philanthropy in the United States; businesses and institutions rank
        among the top in the country for environmental sustainability and investment.
        The city has one of the highest costs of living in the United States as it
        has undergone gentrification, though it remains high on world livability rankings.\n\n\n==
        History ==\n\n\n=== Colonial ===\n\nBoston''s early European settlers had
        first called the area Trimountaine (after its \"three mountains,\" only traces
        of which remain today) but later renamed it Boston after Boston, Lincolnshire,
        England, the origin of several prominent colonists. The renaming on September
        7, 1630, (Old Style) was by Puritan colonists from England who had moved over
        from Charlestown earlier that year in quest of fresh water. Their settlement
        was initially limited to the Shawmut Peninsula, at that time surrounded by
        the Massachusetts Bay and Charles River and connected to the mainland by a
        narrow isthmus. The peninsula is thought to have been inhabited as early as
        5000 BC.\nIn 1629, the Massachusetts Bay Colony''s first governor John Winthrop
        led the signing of the Cambridge Agreement, a key founding document of the
        city. Puritan ethics and their focus on education influenced its early history;
        America''s first public school was founded in Boston in 1635. Over the next
        130 years, the city participated in four French and Indian Wars, until the
        British defeated the French and their Indian allies in North America.\nBoston
        was the largest town in British America until Philadelphia grew larger in
        the mid-18th century. Boston''s proximity to the ocean made it a lively port,
        and the city primarily engaged in shipping and fishing during its colonial
        days. However, Boston stagnated in the decades prior to the Revolution. By
        the mid-18th century, New York City and Philadelphia surpassed Boston in wealth.
        Boston encountered financial difficulties even as other cities in New England
        grew rapidly.\n\n\n=== Revolution and the Siege of Boston ===\n\nMany of the
        crucial events of the American Revolution occurred in or near Boston. Boston''s
        penchant for mob action along with the colonists'' growing distrust in Britain
        fostered a revolutionary spirit in the city. When the British government passed
        the Stamp Act in 1765, a Boston mob ravaged the homes of Andrew Oliver, the
        official tasked with enforcing the Act, and Thomas Hutchinson, then the Lieutenant
        Governor of Massachusetts. The British sent two regiments to Boston in 1768
        in an attempt to quell the angry colonists. This did not bode well with the
        colonists. In 1770, during the Boston Massacre, the army killed several people
        in response to a mob in Boston. The colonists compelled the British to withdraw
        their troops. The event was widely publicized and fueled a revolutionary movement
        in America.\nIn 1773, Britain passed the Tea Act. Many of the colonists saw
        the act as an attempt to force them to accept the taxes established by the
        Townshend Acts. The act prompted the Boston Tea Party, where a group of rebels
        threw an entire shipment of tea sent by the British East India Company into
        Boston Harbor. The Boston Tea Party was a key event leading up to the revolution,
        as the British government responded furiously with the Intolerable Acts, demanding
        compensation for the lost tea from the rebels. This angered the colonists
        further and led to the American Revolutionary War. The war began in the area
        surrounding Boston with the Battles of Lexington and Concord.\nBoston itself
        was besieged for almost a year during the Siege of Boston, which began on
        April 19, 1775. The New England militia impeded the movement of the British
        Army. William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe, then the commander-in-chief of the
        British forces in North America, led the British army in the siege. On June
        17, the British captured the Charlestown peninsula in Boston, during the Battle
        of Bunker Hill. The British army outnumbered the militia stationed there,
        but it was a Pyrrhic victory for the British because their army suffered devastating
        casualties. It was also a testament to the power and courage of the militia,
        as their stubborn defending made it difficult for the British to capture Charlestown
        without losing many troops.\nSeveral weeks later, George Washington took over
        the militia after the Continental Congress established the Continental Army
        to unify the revolutionary effort. Both sides faced difficulties and supply
        shortages in the siege, and the fighting was limited to small-scale raids
        and skirmishes. On March 4, 1776, Washington commanded his army to fortify
        Dorchester Heights, an area of Boston. The army placed cannons there to repel
        a British invasion against their stake in Boston. Washington was confident
        that the army would be able to repel a small-scale invasion with their fortifications.
        Howe planned an invasion into Boston, but bad weather delayed their advance.
        Howe reconsidered his invasion, and decided to withdraw. British troops evacuated
        Boston on March 17, which solidified the revolutionaries'' control of the
        city.\n\n\n=== Post-revolution and the War of 1812 ===\n\nAfter the Revolution,
        Boston''s long seafaring tradition helped make it one of the world''s wealthiest
        international ports, with the slave trade, rum, fish, salt, and tobacco being
        particularly important. Boston''s harbor activity was significantly curtailed
        by the Embargo Act of 1807 (adopted during the Napoleonic Wars) and the War
        of 1812. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston''s merchants
        had found alternatives for their capital investments in the interim. Manufacturing
        became an important component of the city''s economy, and the city''s industrial
        manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th
        century. Boston remained one of the nation''s largest manufacturing centers
        until the early 20th century, and was known for its garment production and
        leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and
        connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and
        led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads
        furthered the region''s industry and commerce.\n\nDuring this period, Boston
        flourished culturally, as well, admired for its rarefied literary life and
        generous artistic patronage, with members of old Boston families\u2014eventually
        dubbed Boston Brahmins\u2014coming to be regarded as the nation''s social
        and cultural elites.\nBoston was an early port of the Atlantic triangular
        slave trade in the New England colonies, but was soon overtaken by Salem,
        Massachusetts and Newport, Rhode Island. Boston eventually became a center
        of the abolitionist movement. The city reacted strongly to the Fugitive Slave
        Act of 1850, contributing to President Franklin Pierce''s attempt to make
        an example of Boston after the Anthony Burns Fugitive Slave Case.\nIn 1822,
        the citizens of Boston voted to change the official name from the \"Town of
        Boston\" to the \"City of Boston\", and on March 4, 1822, the people of Boston
        accepted the charter incorporating the City. At the time Boston was chartered
        as a city, the population was about 46,226, while the area of the city was
        only 4.7 square miles (12 km2).\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn the 1820s, Boston''s
        population grew rapidly, and the city''s ethnic composition changed dramatically
        with the first wave of European immigrants. Irish immigrants dominated the
        first wave of newcomers during this period, especially following the Irish
        Potato Famine; by 1850, about 35,000 Irish lived in Boston. In the latter
        half of the 19th century, the city saw increasing numbers of Irish, Germans,
        Lebanese, Syrians, French Canadians, and Russian and Polish Jews settling
        in the city. By the end of the 19th century, Boston''s core neighborhoods
        had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants. Italians inhabited
        the North End, Irish dominated South Boston and Charlestown, and Russian Jews
        lived in the West End. Irish and Italian immigrants brought with them Roman
        Catholicism. Currently, Catholics make up Boston''s largest religious community,
        and the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics since the early
        20th century; prominent figures include the Kennedys, Tip O''Neill, and John
        F. Fitzgerald.\nBetween 1631 and 1890, the city tripled its area through land
        reclamation by filling in marshes, mud flats, and gaps between wharves along
        the waterfront. The largest reclamation efforts took place during the 19th
        century; beginning in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to fill in a
        50-acre (20 ha) mill pond that later became the Haymarket Square area. The
        present-day State House sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects
        in the middle of the century created significant parts of the South End, the
        West End, the Financial District, and Chinatown.\nAfter the Great Boston fire
        of 1872, workers used building rubble as landfill along the downtown waterfront.
        During the mid-to-late 19th century, workers filled almost 600 acres (2.4
        km2) of brackish Charles River marshlands west of Boston Common with gravel
        brought by rail from the hills of Needham Heights. The city annexed the adjacent
        towns of South Boston (1804), East Boston (1836), Roxbury (1868), Dorchester
        (including present-day Mattapan and a portion of South Boston) (1870), Brighton
        (including present-day Allston) (1874), West Roxbury (including present-day
        Jamaica Plain and Roslindale) (1874), Charlestown (1874), and Hyde Park (1912).
        Other proposals were unsuccessful for the annexation of Brookline, Cambridge,
        and Chelsea.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe city went into decline by the
        early to mid-20th century, as factories became old and obsolete and businesses
        moved out of the region for cheaper labor elsewhere. Boston responded by initiating
        various urban renewal projects, under the direction of the Boston Redevelopment
        Authority (BRA) established in 1957. In 1958, BRA initiated a project to improve
        the historic West End neighborhood. Extensive demolition was met with strong
        public opposition.\nThe BRA subsequently re-evaluated its approach to urban
        renewal in its future projects, including the construction of Government Center.
        In 1965, the Columbia Point Health Center opened in the Dorchester neighborhood,
        the first Community Health Center in the United States. It mostly served the
        massive Columbia Point public housing complex adjoining it, which was built
        in 1953. The health center is still in operation and was rededicated in 1990
        as the Geiger-Gibson Community Health Center. The Columbia Point complex itself
        was redeveloped and revitalized from 1984 to 1990 into a mixed-income residential
        development called Harbor Point Apartments.\nBy the 1970s, the city''s economy
        had recovered after 30 years of economic downturn. A large number of high-rises
        were constructed in the Financial District and in Boston''s Back Bay during
        this period. This boom continued into the mid-1980s and resumed after a few
        pauses. Hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess
        Medical Center, and Brigham and Women''s Hospital lead the nation in medical
        innovation and patient care. Schools such as Boston College, Boston University,
        the Harvard Medical School, Tufts University School of Medicine, Northeastern
        University, Massachusetts College of Art and Design, Wentworth Institute of
        Technology, Berklee College of Music, and Boston Conservatory attract students
        to the area. Nevertheless, the city experienced conflict starting in 1974
        over desegregation busing, which resulted in unrest and violence around public
        schools throughout the mid-1970s.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nBoston is an
        intellectual, technological, and political center but has lost some important
        regional institutions, including the loss to mergers and acquisitions of local
        financial institutions such as FleetBoston Financial, which was acquired by
        Charlotte-based Bank of America in 2004. Boston-based department stores Jordan
        Marsh and Filene''s have both merged into the Cincinnati\u2013based Macy''s.
        The 1993 acquisition of The Boston Globe by The New York Times was reversed
        in 2013 when it was re-sold to Boston businessman John W. Henry. In 2016,
        it was announced that General Electric would be moving its corporate headquarters
        from Connecticut to the Innovation District in South Boston, joining many
        other companies in this rapidly developing neighborhood.\nBoston has experienced
        gentrification in the latter half of the 20th century, with housing prices
        increasing sharply since the 1990s. Living expenses have risen; Boston has
        one of the highest costs of living in the United States and was ranked the
        129th-most expensive major city in the world in a 2011 survey of 214 cities.
        Despite cost of living issues, Boston ranks high on livability ratings, ranking
        36th worldwide in quality of living in 2011 in a survey of 221 major cities.\nOn
        April 15, 2013, two Chechen Islamist brothers detonated a pair of bombs near
        the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring
        roughly 264.\nIn 2016, Boston briefly shouldered a bid as the US applicant
        for the 2024 Summer Olympics. The bid was supported by the mayor and a coalition
        of business leaders and local philanthropists, but was eventually dropped
        due to public opposition. The USOC then selected Los Angeles to be the American
        candidate with Los Angeles ultimately securing the right to host the 2028
        Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBoston has an area of 89.63 square
        miles (232.1 km2)\u201448.4 square miles (125.4 km2) (54.0%) of land and 41.2
        square miles (106.7 km2) (46.0%) of water. The city''s official elevation,
        as measured at Logan International Airport, is 19 ft (5.8 m) above sea level.
        The highest point in Boston is Bellevue Hill at 330 feet (100 m) above sea
        level, and the lowest point is at sea level. Situated onshore of the Atlantic
        Ocean, Boston is the only state capital in the contiguous United States with
        an oceanic shoreline.\n\nThe geographical center of Boston is in Roxbury.
        Due north of the center we find the South End. This is not to be confused
        with South Boston which lies directly east from the South End. North of the
        South End is East Boston and southwest of East Boston is the North End.\n\nBoston
        is surrounded by the \"Greater Boston\" region and is contiguously bordered
        by the cities and towns of Winthrop, Revere, Chelsea, Everett, Somerville,
        Cambridge, Watertown, Newton, Brookline, Needham, Dedham, Canton, Milton,
        and Quincy. The Charles River separates Boston from Watertown and the majority
        of Cambridge, and the mass of Boston from its own Charlestown neighborhood.
        To the east lie Boston Harbor and the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation
        Area (which includes part of the city''s territory, specifically Calf Island,
        Gallops Island, Great Brewster Island, Green Island, Little Brewster Island,
        Little Calf Island, Long Island, Lovells Island, Middle Brewster Island, Nixes
        Mate, Outer Brewster Island, Rainsford Island, Shag Rocks, Spectacle Island,
        The Graves, and Thompson Island). The Neponset River forms the boundary between
        Boston''s southern neighborhoods and the city of Quincy and the town of Milton.
        The Mystic River separates Charlestown from Chelsea and Everett, and Chelsea
        Creek and Boston Harbor separate East Boston from Boston proper.\n\n\n===
        Cityscapes ===\n\n \n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nBoston is sometimes called
        a \"city of neighborhoods\" because of the profusion of diverse subsections;
        the city government''s Office of Neighborhood Services has officially designated
        23 neighborhoods. More than two-thirds of inner Boston''s modern land area
        did not exist when the city was founded. Instead, it was created via the gradual
        filling in of the surrounding tidal areas over the centuries, with earth from
        leveling or lowering Boston''s three original hills (the \"Trimountain\",
        after which Tremont Street is named) and with gravel brought by train from
        Needham to fill the Back Bay.\nDowntown and its immediate surroundings consist
        largely of low-rise masonry buildings (often Federal style and Greek Revival)
        interspersed with modern highrises, in the Financial District, Government
        Center, and South Boston. Back Bay includes many prominent landmarks, such
        as the Boston Public Library, Christian Science Center, Copley Square, Newbury
        Street, and New England''s two tallest buildings: the John Hancock Tower and
        the Prudential Center. Near the John Hancock Tower is the old John Hancock
        Building with its prominent illuminated beacon, the color of which forecasts
        the weather. Smaller commercial areas are interspersed among areas of single-family
        homes and wooden/brick multi-family row houses. The South End Historic District
        is the largest surviving contiguous Victorian-era neighborhood in the US.
        The geography of downtown and South Boston was particularly affected by the
        Central Artery/Tunnel Project (known unofficially as the \"Big Dig\") which
        removed the unsightly elevated Central Artery and incorporated new green spaces
        and open areas.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification,
        Boston has a hot summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfa). Summers
        are typically warm and humid, while winters are cold and stormy, with occasional
        periods of heavy snow. Spring and fall are usually cool to mild, with varying
        conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing
        wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the influence of the Atlantic Ocean;
        however, in winter areas near the immediate coast will often see more rain
        than snow as warm air is drawn off the Atlantic at times. The city lies at
        the transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 6b (most of the city) and
        7a (Downtown, South Boston, and East Boston neighborhoods).\nThe hottest month
        is July, with a mean temperature of 73.4 \u00b0F (23.0 \u00b0C). The coldest
        month is January, with a mean of 29.0 \u00b0F (\u22121.7 \u00b0C). Periods
        exceeding 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) in summer and below freezing in winter are
        not uncommon but rarely extended, with about 13 and 25 days per year seeing
        each, respectively. The most recent sub-0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) reading
        occurred on January 7, 2018, when the temperature dipped down to \u22122 \u00b0F
        (\u221219 \u00b0C). In addition, several decades may pass between 100 \u00b0F
        (38 \u00b0C) readings, with the most recent such occurrence on July 22, 2011,
        when the temperature reached 103 \u00b0F (39 \u00b0C). The city''s average
        window for freezing temperatures is November 9 through April 5. Official temperature
        records have ranged from \u221218 \u00b0F (\u221228 \u00b0C) on February 9,
        1934, up to 104 \u00b0F (40 \u00b0C) on July 4, 1911; the record cold daily
        maximum is 2 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C) on December 30, 1917, while, conversely,
        the record warm daily minimum is 83 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C) on August 2, 1975.\nBoston''s
        coastal location on the North Atlantic moderates its temperature but makes
        the city very prone to Nor''easter weather systems that can produce much snow
        and rain. The city averages 43.8 inches (1,110 mm) of precipitation a year,
        with 43.8 inches (111 cm) of snowfall per season. Snowfall increases dramatically
        as one goes inland away from the city (especially north and west of the city)\u2014away
        from the moderating influence of the ocean. Most snowfall occurs from mid-November
        through early April, and snow is rare in May and October. There is also high
        year-to-year variability in snowfall; for instance, the winter of 2011\u201312
        saw only 9.3 in (23.6 cm) of accumulating snow, but the previous winter, the
        corresponding figure was 81.0 in (2.06 m).\n\nFog is fairly common, particularly
        in spring and early summer. Due to its situation along the North Atlantic,
        the city often receives sea breezes, especially in the late spring, when water
        temperatures are still quite cold and temperatures at the coast can be more
        than 20 \u00b0F (11 \u00b0C) colder than a few miles inland, sometimes dropping
        by that amount near midday. Thunderstorms occur from May to September, that
        are occasionally severe with large hail, damaging winds and heavy downpours.
        Although downtown Boston has never been struck by a violent tornado, the city
        itself has experienced many tornado warnings. Damaging storms are more common
        to areas north, west, and northwest of the city. Boston has a relatively sunny
        climate for a coastal city at its latitude, averaging over 2,300 hours of
        sunshine per annum.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn 2016, Boston was estimated
        to have 673,184 residents (a density of 13,841 persons/sq mi, or 5,344/km2)
        living in 272,481 housing units\u2014a 9% population increase over 2010. The
        city is the third-most densely populated large U.S. city of over half a million
        residents. Some 1.2 million persons may be within Boston''s boundaries during
        work hours, and as many as 2 million during special events. This fluctuation
        of people is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel
        to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.\nIn the
        city, the population was spread out with 21.9% at age 19 and under, 14.3%
        from 20 to 24, 33.2% from 25 to 44, 20.4% from 45 to 64, and 10.1% who were
        65 years of age or older. The median age was 30.8 years. For every 100 females,
        there were 92.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.9
        males. There were 252,699 households, of which 20.4% had children under the
        age of 18 living in them, 25.5% were married couples living together, 16.3%
        had a female householder with no husband present, and 54.0% were non-families.
        37.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.0% had someone living
        alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.26
        and the average family size was 3.08. Boston has one of the largest LGBT populations
        in the United States.\nThe median household income in Boston was $51,739,
        while the median income for a family was $61,035. Full-time year-round male
        workers had a median income of $52,544 versus $46,540 for full-time year-round
        female workers. The per capita income for the city was $33,158. 21.4% of the
        population and 16.0% of families are below the poverty line. Of the total
        population, 28.8% of those under the age of 18 and 20.4% of those 65 and older
        were living below the poverty line.\nIn 1950, Whites represented 94.7% of
        Boston''s population. From the 1950s to the end of the 20th century, the proportion
        of non-Hispanic whites in the city declined; in 2000, non-Hispanic whites
        made up 49.5% of the city''s population, making the city majority minority
        for the first time. However, in the 21st century, the city has experienced
        significant gentrification, in which affluent whites have moved into formerly
        non-white areas. In 2006, the US Census Bureau estimated that non-Hispanic
        whites again formed a slight majority. But as of 2010, in part due to the
        housing crash, as well as increased efforts to make more affordable housing
        more available, the non-white population has rebounded. This may also have
        to do with increased Latin American and Asian populations and more clarity
        surrounding US Census statistics, which indicate a non-Hispanic white population
        of 47 percent (some reports give slightly lower figures).\n\nPeople of Irish
        descent form the largest single ethnic group in the city, making up 15.8%
        of the population, followed by Italians, accounting for 8.3% of the population.
        People of West Indian and Caribbean ancestry are another sizable group, at
        6.0%, about half of whom are of Haitian ancestry. Over 27,000 Chinese Americans
        made their home in Boston city proper in 2013, and the city hosts a growing
        Chinatown accommodating heavily traveled Chinese-owned bus lines to and from
        Chinatown, Manhattan in New York City. Some neighborhoods, such as Dorchester,
        have received an influx of people of Vietnamese ancestry in recent decades.
        Neighborhoods such as Jamaica Plain and Roslindale have experienced a growing
        number of Dominican Americans. The city and greater area also has a growing
        immigrant population of South Asians, including the tenth-largest Indian population
        in the country.\n\nThe city, especially the East Boston neighborhood, has
        a significant Hispanic population. In 2010, Hispanics in Boston were mostly
        of Puerto Rican (30,506 or 4.9% of total city population), Dominican (25,648
        or 4.2% of total city population), Salvadoran (10,850 or 1.8% of city population),
        Colombian (6,649 or 1.1% of total city population), Mexican (5,961 or 1.0%
        of total city population), and Guatemalan (4,451 or 0.7% of total city population)
        ethnic origin. Hispanics of all national origins totaled 107,917 in 2010.
        In Greater Boston, these numbers grew significantly, with Puerto Ricans numbering
        175,000+, Dominicans 95,000+, Salvadorans 40,000+, Guatemalans 31,000+, Mexicans
        25,000+, and Colombians numbering 22,000+.\n\n\n=== Demographic breakdown
        by ZIP Code ===\n\n\n==== Income ====\n\nData is from the 2008\u20132012 American
        Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to a
        2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 57% of the population of the city identified
        themselves as Christians, with 25% professing attendance at a variety of churches
        that could be considered Protestant, and 29% professing Roman Catholic beliefs.
        while 33% claim no religious affiliation. The same study says that other religions
        (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about
        10% of the population.\nAs of 2010 the Catholic Church had the highest number
        of adherents as a single denomination in the Boston-Cambridge-Newton Metro
        area, with more than two million members and 339 churches, followed by the
        Episcopal Church with 58,000 adherents in 160 churches. The United Church
        of Christ had 55,000 members and 213 churches. The UCC is the successor of
        the city''s Puritan religious traditions. Old South Church in Boston is one
        of the oldest congregations in the United States. It was organized in 1669
        by dissenters from the First Church in Boston (1630). Past members include
        Samuel Adams, William Dawes, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Sewall, and Phillis
        Wheatley. In 1773, Adams gave the signals from the Old South Meeting House
        that started the Boston Tea Party.\nThe city has a sizable Jewish population
        with an estimated 248,000 Jews within the Boston metro area. More than half
        of Jewish households in the Greater Boston area reside in the city itself,
        Brookline, Newton, Cambridge, Somerville, or adjacent towns.\n\n\n== Economy
        ==\n\nA global city, Boston is placed among the top 30 most economically powerful
        cities in the world. Encompassing $363 billion, the Greater Boston metropolitan
        area has the sixth-largest economy in the country and 12th-largest in the
        world.\nBoston''s colleges and universities exert a significant impact on
        the regional economy. Boston attracts more than 350,000 college students from
        around the world, who contribute more than US$4.8 billion annually to the
        city''s economy. The area''s schools are major employers and attract industries
        to the city and surrounding region. The city is home to a number of technology
        companies and is a hub for biotechnology, with the Milken Institute rating
        Boston as the top life sciences cluster in the country. Boston receives the
        highest absolute amount of annual funding from the National Institutes of
        Health of all cities in the United States.\nThe city is considered highly
        innovative for a variety of reasons, including the presence of academia, access
        to venture capital, and the presence of many high-tech companies. The Route
        128 corridor and Greater Boston continue to be a major center for venture
        capital investment, and high technology remains an important sector.\nTourism
        also composes a large part of Boston''s economy, with 21.2 million domestic
        and international visitors spending $8.3 billion in 2011; excluding visitors
        from Canada and Mexico, over 1.4 million international tourists visited Boston
        in 2014, with those from China and the United Kingdom leading the list. Boston''s
        status as a state capital as well as the regional home of federal agencies
        has rendered law and government to be another major component of the city''s
        economy. The city is a major seaport along the East Coast of the United States
        and the oldest continuously operated industrial and fishing port in the Western
        Hemisphere.\nThe financial services industry is important to Boston, especially
        involving mutual funds and insurance. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres
        Index, Boston was ranked as having the ninth-most competitive financial center
        in the world and the fourth-most competitive in the United States. Boston-based
        Fidelity Investments helped popularize the mutual fund in the 1980s and has
        made Boston one of the top financial centers in the United States. The city
        is home to the headquarters of Santander Bank, and Boston is a center for
        venture capital firms. State Street Corporation, which specializes in asset
        management and custody services, is based in the city. Boston is a printing
        and publishing center\u2014Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is headquartered within
        the city, along with Bedford-St. Martin''s Press and Beacon Press. Pearson
        PLC publishing units also employ several hundred people in Boston. The city
        is home to three major convention centers\u2014the Hynes Convention Center
        in the Back Bay, and the Seaport World Trade Center and Boston Convention
        and Exhibition Center on the South Boston waterfront. The General Electric
        Corporation announced in January 2016 its decision to move the company''s
        global headquarters to the Seaport District in Boston, from Fairfield, Connecticut,
        citing factors including Boston''s preeminence in the realm of higher education.
        Boston is home to the headquarters of several major athletic and footwear
        companies including Converse, New Balance, and Reebok. Rockport, Puma and
        Wolverine World Wide, Inc. headquarters or regional offices are located just
        outside the city.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education
        ===\n\nThe Boston Public Schools enroll 57,000 students attending 145 schools,
        including the renowned Boston Latin Academy, John D. O''Bryant School of Math
        & Science, and Boston Latin School. The Boston Latin School was established
        in 1635 and is the oldest public high school in the US. Boston also operates
        the United States'' second-oldest public high school and its oldest public
        elementary school. The system''s students are 40% Hispanic or Latino, 35%
        Black or African American, 13% White, and 9% Asian. There are private, parochial,
        and charter schools as well, and approximately 3,300 minority students attend
        participating suburban schools through the Metropolitan Educational Opportunity
        Council.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nSome of the most renowned and highly
        ranked universities in the world are located near Boston. Three universities
        with a major presence in the city, Harvard, MIT, and Tufts, are located just
        outside of Boston in the cities of Cambridge and Somerville, known as the
        Brainpower Triangle. Harvard is the nation''s oldest institute of higher education
        and is centered across the Charles River in Cambridge, though the majority
        of its land holdings and a substantial amount of its educational activities
        are in Boston. Its business, medical, dental, and public health schools are
        located in Boston''s Allston and Longwood neighborhoods, and Harvard has plans
        for additional expansion into Allston.\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology
        (MIT) originated in Boston and was long known as \"Boston Tech\"; it moved
        across the river to Cambridge in 1916. Tufts University''s main campus is
        north of the city in Somerville and Medford, though it locates its medical
        and dental schools in Boston''s Chinatown at Tufts Medical Center, a 451-bed
        academic medical institution that is home to both a full-service hospital
        for adults and the Floating Hospital for Children.\nFour members of the Association
        of American Universities are in Greater Boston (more than any other metropolitan
        area): Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston
        University, and Brandeis University. Furthermore, Greater Boston contains
        seven Highest Research Activity (R1) Universities as per the Carnegie Classification.
        This includes, in addition to the aforementioned four, Boston College, Northeastern
        University, and Tufts University. This is, by a large margin, the highest
        concentration of such institutions in a single metropolitan area. Hospitals,
        universities, and research institutions in Greater Boston received more than
        $1.77 billion in National Institutes of Health grants in 2013, more money
        than any other American metropolitan area.\nGreater Boston has more than 100
        colleges and universities, with 250,000 students enrolled in Boston and Cambridge
        alone. The city''s largest private universities include Boston University
        (also the city''s fourth-largest employer), with its main campus along Commonwealth
        Avenue and a medical campus in the South End; Northeastern University in the
        Fenway area; Suffolk University near Beacon Hill, which includes law school
        and business school; and Boston College, which straddles the Boston (Brighton)\u2013Newton
        border. Boston''s only public university is the University of Massachusetts
        Boston on Columbia Point in Dorchester. Roxbury Community College and Bunker
        Hill Community College are the city''s two public community colleges. Altogether,
        Boston''s colleges and universities employ more than 42,600 people, accounting
        for nearly seven percent of the city''s workforce.\n\nSmaller private schools
        include Babson College, Bentley University, Boston Architectural College,
        Emmanuel College, Fisher College, MGH Institute of Health Professions, Massachusetts
        College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Simmons College, Wellesley College,
        Wheelock College, Wentworth Institute of Technology, New England School of
        Law (originally established as America''s first all female law school), and
        Emerson College.\nMetropolitan Boston is home to several conservatories and
        art schools, including Lesley University College of Art and Design, Massachusetts
        College of Art, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, New England Institute
        of Art, New England School of Art and Design (Suffolk University), Longy School
        of Music of Bard College, and the New England Conservatory (the oldest independent
        conservatory in the United States). Other conservatories include the Boston
        Conservatory and Berklee College of Music, which has made Boston an important
        city for jazz music.\n\n\n== Public safety ==\n\nLike many major American
        cities, Boston has seen a great reduction in violent crime since the early
        1990s. Boston''s low crime rate since the 1990s has been credited to the Boston
        Police Department''s collaboration with neighborhood groups and church parishes
        to prevent youths from joining gangs, as well as involvement from the United
        States Attorney and District Attorney''s offices. This helped lead in part
        to what has been touted as the \"Boston Miracle\". Murders in the city dropped
        from 152 in 1990 (for a murder rate of 26.5 per 100,000 people) to just 31\u2014not
        one of them a juvenile\u2014in 1999 (for a murder rate of 5.26 per 100,000).\nIn
        2008, there were 62 reported homicides. Through December 30, 2016, major crime
        was down seven percent and there were 46 homicides compared to 40 in 2015.\n\n\n==
        Culture ==\n\nBoston shares many cultural roots with greater New England,
        including a dialect of the non-rhotic Eastern New England accent known as
        the Boston accent and a regional cuisine with a large emphasis on seafood,
        salt, and dairy products. Boston also has its own collection of neologisms
        known as Boston slang.\n\nIn the early 1800s, William Tudor wrote that Boston
        was \"''perhaps the most perfect and certainly the best-regulated democracy
        that ever existed. There is something so impossible in the immortal fame of
        Athens, that the very name makes everything modern shrink from comparison;
        but since the days of that glorious city I know of none that has approached
        so near in some points, distant as it may still be from that illustrious model.''
        From this, Boston has been called the \"Athens of America\" (also a nickname
        of Philadelphia) for its literary culture, earning a reputation as \"the intellectual
        capital of the United States.\"\nIn the nineteenth century, Ralph Waldo Emerson,
        Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Margaret Fuller, James Russell Lowell,
        and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote in Boston. Some consider the Old Corner
        Bookstore to be the \"cradle of American literature,\" the place where these
        writers met and where The Atlantic Monthly was first published. In 1852, the
        Boston Public Library was founded as the first free library in the United
        States. Boston''s literary culture continues today thanks to the city''s many
        universities and the Boston Book Festival.\n\nMusic is afforded a high degree
        of civic support in Boston. The Boston Symphony Orchestra is one of the \"Big
        Five,\" a group of the greatest American orchestras, and the classical music
        magazine Gramophone called it one of the \"world''s best\" orchestras. Symphony
        Hall (located west of Back Bay) is home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra and
        the related Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra, which is the largest youth orchestra
        in the nation, and to the Boston Pops Orchestra. The British newspaper The
        Guardian called Boston Symphony Hall \"one of the top venues for classical
        music in the world,\" adding that \"Symphony Hall in Boston was where science
        became an essential part of concert hall design.\" Other concerts are held
        at the New England Conservatory''s Jordan Hall. The Boston Ballet performs
        at the Boston Opera House. Other performing-arts organizations located in
        the city include the Boston Lyric Opera Company, Opera Boston, Boston Baroque
        (the first permanent Baroque orchestra in the US), and the Handel and Haydn
        Society (one of the oldest choral companies in the United States). The city
        is a center for contemporary classical music with a number of performing groups,
        several of which are associated with the city''s conservatories and universities.
        These include the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Boston Musica Viva.
        Several theaters are located in or near the Theater District south of Boston
        Common, including the Cutler Majestic Theatre, Citi Performing Arts Center,
        the Colonial Theater, and the Orpheum Theatre.\nThere are several major annual
        events, such as First Night which occurs on New Year''s Eve, the Boston Early
        Music Festival, the annual Boston Arts Festival at Christopher Columbus Waterfront
        Park, the annual Boston gay pride parade and festival held in June, and Italian
        summer feasts in the North End honoring Catholic saints. The city is the site
        of several events during the Fourth of July period. They include the week-long
        Harborfest festivities and a Boston Pops concert accompanied by fireworks
        on the banks of the Charles River.\n\nSeveral historic sites relating to the
        American Revolution period are preserved as part of the Boston National Historical
        Park because of the city''s prominent role. Many are found along the Freedom
        Trail, which is marked by a red line of bricks embedded in the ground.\nThe
        city is also home to several art museums and galleries, including the Museum
        of Fine Arts and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. The Institute of Contemporary
        Art is housed in a contemporary building designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro
        in the Seaport District. Boston''s South End Art and Design District (SoWa)
        and Newbury St. are both art gallery destinations. Columbia Point is the location
        of the University of Massachusetts Boston, the Edward M. Kennedy Institute
        for the United States Senate, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and
        Museum, and the Massachusetts Archives and Commonwealth Museum. The Boston
        Athen\u00e6um (one of the oldest independent libraries in the United States),
        Boston Children''s Museum, Bull & Finch Pub (whose building is known from
        the television show Cheers), Museum of Science, and the New England Aquarium
        are within the city.\nBoston has been a noted religious center from its earliest
        days. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston serves nearly 300 parishes
        and is based in the Cathedral of the Holy Cross (1875) in the South End, while
        the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts serves just under 200 congregations,
        with the Cathedral Church of St. Paul (1819) as its episcopal seat. Unitarian
        Universalism has its headquarters on Beacon Hill. The Christian Scientists
        are headquartered in Back Bay at the Mother Church (1894). The oldest church
        in Boston is First Church in Boston, founded in 1630. King''s Chapel was the
        city''s first Anglican church, founded in 1686 and converted to Unitarianism
        in 1785. Other churches include Christ Church (better known as Old North Church,
        1723), the oldest church building in the city, Trinity Church (1733), Park
        Street Church (1809), Old South Church (1874), Jubilee Christian Church, and
        Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help on Mission Hill (1878).\n\n\n==
        Environment ==\n\n\n=== Pollution control ===\nAir quality in Boston is generally
        very good. Between 2004\u20132013, there were only four days in which the
        air was unhealthy for the general public, according to the EPA.\nSome of the
        cleaner energy facilities in Boston include the Allston green district, with
        three ecologically compatible housing facilities. Boston is also breaking
        ground on multiple green affordable housing facilities to help reduce the
        carbon impact of the city while simultaneously making these initiatives financially
        available to a greater population. Boston''s climate plan is updated every
        three years and was most recently modified in 2013. This legislature includes
        the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance, which requires the
        city''s larger buildings to disclose their yearly energy and water use statistics
        and to partake in an energy assessment every five years. These statistics
        are made public by the city, thereby increasing incentives for buildings to
        be more environmentally conscious.\nMayor Thomas Menino introduced the Renew
        Boston Whole Building Incentive which reduces the cost of living in buildings
        that are deemed energy efficient. This gives people an opportunity to find
        housing in neighborhoods that support the environment. The ultimate goal of
        this initiative is to enlist 500 Bostonians to participate in a free, in-home
        energy assessment.\n\n\n=== Water purity and availability ===\nMany older
        buildings in certain areas of Boston are supported by wooden piles driven
        into the area''s fill; these piles remain sound if submerged in water, but
        are subject to dry rot if exposed to air for long periods. Ground water levels
        have been dropping in many areas of the city, due in part to an increase in
        the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed
        by the ground. The Boston Groundwater Trust coordinates monitoring ground
        water levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring
        wells. However, Boston''s drinking water supply from the Quabbin and Wachusett
        Reservoirs is one of the very few in the country so pure as to satisfy the
        Federal Clean Water Act without filtration.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nBoston has
        teams in the four major North American professional sports leagues plus Major
        League Soccer, and has won 37 championships in these leagues, As of 2017.
        It is one of five cities (along with Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia)
        to have won championships in all four major sports. It has been suggested
        that Boston is the new \"TitleTown, USA\", as the city''s professional sports
        teams have won ten championships since 2001: Patriots (2001, 2003, 2004, 2014,
        and 2016), Red Sox (2004, 2007, and 2013), Celtics (2008), and Bruins (2011).
        This love of sports made Boston the United States Olympic Committee''s choice
        to bid to hold the 2024 Summer Olympic Games, but the city cited financial
        concerns when it withdrew its bid on July 27, 2015.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox,
        a founding member of the American League of Major League Baseball in 1901,
        play their home games at Fenway Park, near Kenmore Square in the city''s Fenway
        section. Built in 1912, it is the oldest sports arena or stadium in active
        use in the United States among the four major professional American sports
        leagues, Major League Baseball, the National Football League, National Basketball
        Association, and the National Hockey League. Boston was the site of the first
        game of the first modern World Series, in 1903. The series was played between
        the AL Champion Boston Americans and the NL champion Pittsburgh Pirates. Persistent
        reports that the team was known in 1903 as the \"Boston Pilgrims\" appear
        to be unfounded. Boston''s first professional baseball team was the Red Stockings,
        one of the charter members of the National Association in 1871, and of the
        National League in 1876. The team played under that name until 1883, under
        the name Beaneaters until 1911, and under the name Braves from 1912 until
        they moved to Milwaukee after the 1952 season. Since 1966 they have played
        in Atlanta as the Atlanta Braves.\n\nThe TD Garden, formerly called the FleetCenter
        and built to replace the old, since-demolished Boston Garden, is adjoined
        to North Station and is the home of two major league teams: the Boston Bruins
        of the National Hockey League and the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball
        Association. The arena seats 18,624 for basketball games and 17,565 for ice
        hockey games. The Bruins were the first American member of the National Hockey
        League and an Original Six franchise. The Boston Celtics were founding members
        of the Basketball Association of America, one of the two leagues that merged
        to form the NBA. The Celtics have the distinction of having won more championships
        than any other NBA team, with seventeen.\nWhile they have played in suburban
        Foxborough since 1971, the New England Patriots of the National Football League
        were founded in 1960 as the Boston Patriots, changing their name after relocating.
        The team won the Super Bowl after the 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, and 2016 seasons.
        They share Gillette Stadium with the New England Revolution of Major League
        Soccer. The Boston Breakers of Women''s Professional Soccer, which formed
        in 2009, play their home games at Dilboy Stadium in Somerville. The Boston
        Storm of the United Women''s Lacrosse League was formed in 2015.\n\nThe area''s
        many colleges and universities are active in college athletics. Four NCAA
        Division I members play in the city\u2014Boston College, Boston University,
        Harvard University, and Northeastern University. Of the four, only Boston
        College participates in college football at the highest level, the Football
        Bowl Subdivision. Harvard participates in the second-highest level, the Football
        Championship Subdivision. The Boston Cannons of the MLL play at Harvard Stadium.\nOne
        of the best known sporting events in the city is the Boston Marathon, the
        26.2-mile (42.2 km) race which is the world''s oldest annual marathon, run
        on Patriots'' Day in April. On April 15, 2013, two explosions killed three
        people and injured hundreds at the marathon. Another major annual event is
        the Head of the Charles Regatta, held in October.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation
        ==\n\nBoston Common, located near the Financial District and Beacon Hill,
        is the oldest public park in the United States. Along with the adjacent Boston
        Public Garden, it is part of the Emerald Necklace, a string of parks designed
        by Frederick Law Olmsted to encircle the city. The Emerald Necklace includes
        Jamaica Pond, Boston''s largest body of freshwater, and Franklin Park, the
        city''s largest park and home of the Franklin Park Zoo. Another major park
        is the Esplanade, located along the banks of the Charles River. The Hatch
        Shell, an outdoor concert venue, is located adjacent to the Charles River
        Esplanade. Other parks are scattered throughout the city, with the major parks
        and beaches located near Castle Island; in Charlestown; and along the Dorchester,
        South Boston, and East Boston shorelines.\nBoston''s park system is well-reputed
        nationally. In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land reported
        that Boston was tied with Sacramento and San Francisco for having the third-best
        park system among the 50 most populous US cities. ParkScore ranks city park
        systems by a formula that analyzes the city''s median park size, park acres
        as percent of city area, the percent of residents within a half-mile of a
        park, spending of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds
        per 10,000 residents.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBoston has a strong
        mayor \u2013 council government system in which the mayor (elected every fourth
        year) has extensive executive power. Marty Walsh became Mayor in January 2014,
        his predecessor Thomas Menino''s twenty-year tenure having been the longest
        in the city''s history. The Boston City Council is elected every two years;
        there are nine district seats, and four citywide \"at-large\" seats. The School
        Committee, which oversees the Boston Public Schools, is appointed by the mayor.\nIn
        addition to city government, numerous commissions and state authorities\u2014including
        the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Boston Public
        Health Commission, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), and
        the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport)\u2014play a role in the life of
        Bostonians. As the capital of Massachusetts, Boston plays a major role in
        state politics.\nThe city has several federal facilities, including the John
        F. Kennedy Federal Office Building, the Thomas P. O''Neill Jr. Federal Building,
        the John W. McCormack Post Office and Courthouse, the Federal Reserve Bank
        of Boston, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and the
        United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Both courts
        are housed in the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse.\nFederally,
        Boston is split between two congressional districts. The northern three-fourths
        of the city is in the 7th district, represented by Mike Capuano since 1998.
        The southern fourth is in the 8th district, represented by Stephen Lynch.
        Both are Democrats; a Republican has not represented a significant portion
        of Boston in over a century. The state''s senior member of the United States
        Senate is Democrat Elizabeth Warren, first elected in 2012. The state''s junior
        member of the United States Senate is Democrat Ed Markey, who was elected
        in 2013 to succeed John Kerry after Kerry''s appointment and confirmation
        as the United States Secretary of State.\nThe city uses an algorithm created
        by the Walsh administration, called CityScore, to measure the effectiveness
        of various city services. This score is available on a public online dashboard
        and allows city managers in police, fire, schools, emergency management services,
        and 3-1-1 to take action and make adjustments in areas of concern.\n\n\n==
        Media ==\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nThe Boston Globe and the Boston Herald are
        two of the city''s major daily newspapers. The city is also served by other
        publications such as Boston magazine, The Improper Bostonian, DigBoston, and
        the Boston edition of Metro. The Christian Science Monitor, headquartered
        in Boston, was formerly a worldwide daily newspaper but ended publication
        of daily print editions in 2009, switching to continuous online and weekly
        magazine format publications. The Boston Globe also releases a teen publication
        to the city''s public high schools, called Teens in Print or T.i.P., which
        is written by the city''s teens and delivered quarterly within the school
        year.\nThe city''s growing Latino population has given rise to a number of
        local and regional Spanish-language newspapers. These include El Planeta (owned
        by the former publisher of The Boston Phoenix), El Mundo, and La Semana. Siglo21,
        with its main offices in nearby Lawrence, is also widely distributed.\nThere
        are a number of weekly newspapers dedicated to Boston neighborhoods. Among
        them is South Boston Online, (founded in 1999) which appears in print and
        online, and covers events in South Boston and the Seaport District.\nVarious
        LGBT publications serve the city''s large LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
        transgender) population such as The Rainbow Times, the only minority and lesbian-owned
        LGBT news magazine. Founded in 2006, The Rainbow Times is now based out of
        Boston, but serves all of New England.\n\n\n=== Radio and television ===\nBoston
        is the largest broadcasting market in New England, with the radio market being
        the 9th largest in the United States. Several major AM stations include talk
        radio WRKO, sports/talk station WEEI, and CBS Radio WBZ. WBZ (AM) broadcasts
        a news radio format. A variety of commercial FM radio formats serve the area,
        as do NPR stations WBUR and WGBH. College and university radio stations include
        WERS (Emerson), WHRB (Harvard), WUMB (UMass Boston), WMBR (MIT), WZBC (Boston
        College), WMFO (Tufts University), WBRS (Brandeis University), WTBU (Boston
        University, campus and web only), WRBB (Northeastern University) and WMLN-FM
        (Curry College).\nThe Boston television DMA, which also includes Manchester,
        New Hampshire, is the 8th largest in the United States. The city is served
        by stations representing every major American network, including WBZ-TV 4
        and its sister station WSBK-TV 38 (the former a CBS O&O, the latter an MyNetwork
        TV affiliate), WCVB-TV 5 and its sister station WMUR-TV 9 (both ABC), WHDH
        7 and its sister station WLVI 56 (the former an independent station, the latter
        a CW affiliate), WBTS-LD 8 (a NBC O&O), and WFXT 25 (Fox). The city is also
        home to PBS member station WGBH-TV 2, a major producer of PBS programs, which
        also operates WGBX 44. Spanish-language television networks, including Azteca
        (WFXZ-CD 24), Univision (WUNI 27), Telemundo (WNEU 60, a sister station to
        WBTS-LD), and UniM\u00e1s (WUTF-DT 66), have a presence in the region, with
        WNEU and WUTF serving as network owned-and-operated stations. Most of the
        area''s television stations have their transmitters in nearby Needham and
        Newton along the Route 128 corridor. Six Boston television stations are carried
        by Canadian satellite television provider Bell TV and by cable television
        providers in Canada.\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nFilms have been made in Boston since
        as early as 1903, and it continues to be both a popular setting and a popular
        site for location shooting.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe Longwood Medical
        and Academic Area, adjacent to the Fenway district, is home to a large number
        of medical and research facilities, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
        Center, Brigham and Women''s Hospital, Boston Children''s Hospital, Dana\u2013Farber
        Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Joslin Diabetes Center, and the
        Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. Prominent medical facilities,
        including Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary
        and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital are located in the Beacon Hill area.
        St. Elizabeth''s Medical Center is in Brighton Center of the city''s Brighton
        neighborhood. New England Baptist Hospital is in Mission Hill. The city has
        Veterans Affairs medical centers in the Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury neighborhoods.
        The Boston Public Health Commission, an agency of the Massachusetts government,
        oversees health concerns for city residents. Boston EMS provides pre-hospital
        emergency medical services to residents and visitors.\nMany of Boston''s medical
        facilities are associated with universities. The facilities in the Longwood
        Medical and Academic Area and in Massachusetts General Hospital are affiliated
        with Harvard Medical School. Tufts Medical Center (formerly Tufts-New England
        Medical Center), located in the southern portion of the Chinatown neighborhood,
        is affiliated with Tufts University School of Medicine. Boston Medical Center,
        located in the South End neighborhood, is the primary teaching facility for
        the Boston University School of Medicine as well as the largest trauma center
        in the Boston area; it was formed by the merger of Boston University Hospital
        and Boston City Hospital, which was the first municipal hospital in the United
        States.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nLogan Airport,
        located in East Boston and operated by the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport),
        is Boston''s principal airport. Nearby general aviation airports are Beverly
        Municipal Airport to the north, Hanscom Field to the west, and Norwood Memorial
        Airport to the south. Massport also operates several major facilities within
        the Port of Boston, including a cruise ship terminal and facilities to handle
        bulk and container cargo in South Boston, and other facilities in Charlestown
        and East Boston.\n\nDowntown Boston''s streets grew organically, so they do
        not form a planned grid, unlike those in later-developed Back Bay, East Boston,
        the South End, and South Boston. Boston is the eastern terminus of I-90, which
        in Massachusetts runs along the Massachusetts Turnpike. The elevated portion
        of the Central Artery, which carried most of the through traffic in downtown
        Boston, was replaced with the O''Neill Tunnel during the Big Dig, substantially
        completed in early 2006.\nWith nearly a third of Bostonians using public transit
        for their commute to work, Boston has the fifth-highest rate of public transit
        usage in the country. The city of Boston has a higher than average percentage
        of households without a car. In 2015, 35.4 percent of Boston households lacked
        a car, which decreased slightly to 33.8 percent in 2016. The national average
        was 8.7 percent in 2016. Boston averaged 0.94 cars per household in 2016,
        compared to a national average of 1.8. Boston''s subway system, the Massachusetts
        Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA\u2014known as the \"T\") operates the oldest
        underground rapid transit system in the Americas, and is the fourth-busiest
        rapid transit system in the country, with 65.5 miles (105 km) of track on
        four lines. The MBTA also operates busy bus and commuter rail networks, and
        water shuttles.\nAmtrak''s Northeast Corridor and Chicago lines originate
        at South Station, which serves as a major intermodal transportation hub, and
        stop at Back Bay. Fast Northeast Corridor trains, which serve New York City,
        Washington, D.C., and points in between, also stop at Route 128 Station in
        the southwestern suburbs of Boston. Meanwhile, Amtrak''s Downeaster service
        to Maine originates at North Station, despite the current lack of a dedicated
        passenger rail link between the two railhubs, other than the \"T\" subway
        lines.\nNicknamed \"The Walking City\", Boston hosts more pedestrian commuters
        than do other comparably populated cities. Owing to factors such as necessity,
        the compactness of the city and large student population, 13 percent of the
        population commutes by foot, making it the highest percentage of pedestrian
        commuters in the country out of the major American cities. In 2011, Walk Score
        ranked Boston the third most walkable city in the United States. As of 2015,
        Walk Score still ranks Boston as the third most walkable US city, with a Walk
        Score of 80, a Transit Score of 75, and a Bike Score of 70.\nBetween 1999
        and 2006, Bicycling magazine named Boston three times as one of the worst
        cities in the US for cycling; regardless, it has one of the highest rates
        of bicycle commuting. In 2008, as a consequence of improvements made to bicycling
        conditions within the city, the same magazine put Boston on its \"Five for
        the Future\" list as a \"Future Best City\" for biking, and Boston''s bicycle
        commuting percentage increased from 1% in 2000 to 2.1% in 2009. The bikeshare
        program called Hubway launched in late July 2011, logging more than 140,000
        rides before the close of its first season. The neighboring municipalities
        of Cambridge, Somerville, and Brookline joined the Hubway program in the summer
        of 2012. In 2016, there are 1,461 bikes and 158 docking stations across the
        city. PBSC Urban Solutions provides bicycles and technology for this bike-sharing
        system.\nIn 2013, the Boston-Cambridge-Newton metropolitan statistical area
        (Boston MSA) had the seventh-lowest percentage of workers who commuted by
        private automobile (75.6 percent), with 6.2 percent of area workers traveling
        via rail transit. During the period starting in 2006 and ending in 2013, the
        Boston MSA had the greatest percentage decline of workers commuting by automobile
        (3.3 percent) among MSAs with more than a half-million residents.\n\n\n==
        Twin towns and sister cities ==\n\nBoston has nine official sister cities
        as recognized by Sister Cities International.\nBoston has less formal friendship
        or partnership relationships with three additional cities.\nIn 1900, Americans
        from Boston bought a piece of land in Bellville, Western Cape, South Africa
        and developed it for residential purposes. In memory of their hometown, they
        called it Boston.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBoston City League (high school athletic
